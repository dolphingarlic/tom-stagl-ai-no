<|startoftext|>Pointy student? Look what it got these three: Less worrying and more enjoying life. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should be almost impossible to do, unless you were considered a resident of SOuth Carolina when you received your permit. Given that TSA is requiring Real IDs and announced that well over a year ago, South Carolina would have been rigorous in making certain your were, then, a resident. So now you are a resident of California. You MUST go to the DMV and get a California learner’s permit. Otherwise you will be in Big Trouble when you try to take your road test and get your license…. Just Do It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mom and Pop Just like we called them….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will assume that by “child” you mean a Minor in the USA. Therefore, someone who is Under the age of 18. I say this Over and Over and Over again. As a PARENT (not as a buddy). when you have Minor children, YOU own the phone and YOU pay for the cell phone plan. The plan and the phone are in the name of a Parent. Then, as long as the Minor child acts responsibly, per the rules that you set, the child borrows the phone and uses it. And as the plan owner, you can log-on to your plan’s web-site and see all of the phone numbers contacted by your Minor child and when. Later, when that person becomes an Adult, you might Give the phone to them or merely encourage them to Buy their own phone and Pay for their own contract cell plan. Simple. If the Minor child violates a rule, that triggers confiscation, then you Take the Phone, per the pre-established rules. Simple. Be a Parent and not a buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a PhD thesis. The culmination of four or many more years of exhausting and leading-edge work. Of course you should be having Extensive discussions with both your adviser and with your entire doctoral committee. Even if your thesis was Highly ranked, you would still be having those Long professional discussions with your adviser and the committee. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The key to landing a helicopter in your back yard has Nothing to do (in the USA) with the FAA nor the USDOT. It has all to do with local zoning ordinances and local town/city/state laws. If you will be routinely landing a helicopter in your backyard, you should have a “helipad” of some type built to support the operation of your helicopter and you should inform the FAA of its existence. Not asking permission, but merely informing. However, if you disturb your neighbors in Any way, you can be assured that they will complain to the local authorities and everyone will be checking zoning regulations and local laws. And those regulations or laws can be changed because of you to Prevent you from landing your helicopter in your back yard. Enjoy your flying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am doing this from the parent’s side (parents of the little children and parents of the baby sitter). Tell your parents where you are going, what the the address is and call them when you are expected to leave that location to return home, At 13, I am hoping that you are baby sitting within Walking distance of your house. If not, pre-arrange who is going to take you home in advance and let your parents know. As a parent of a 13 year old, I would contact the family if I did not know them to find out more about them or my child will Not be baby sitting at that age. At 13 you should Not be taking care of any children that are under the age of 2 years old. Period. When our two sons (either) were under the age of two, we hired Two adult (college students) to baby sit, one for each of them…….. Find out from the parents, in advance, where they will be, how you can reach them in an emergency and when they will be home. Find out the phone number for the local police and fire department. Find out if any of the children have any allergies, asthma, diabetes, etc. Find out what the children like to eat, and if they are allowed snacks while you are there. If you have to put the children to bed, find out where they sleep, what they like to wear, and what is their bedtime routine. In advance from the Parents. Have the children know that You know the routine from the parents NEVER leave a young child in a bathtub, or shower or pool unsupervised. NEVER. NEVER have any friends over while baby sitting. Do Not text/call friends while you are baby sitting. You are being Paid to be with the children. Find out in advance if the children are allowed to use smart phones or computers and what web sites are they allowed to access. Same for TV stations and shows. Remember that You are in charge, and do Not let the children try to fool you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who sends out high school graduation announcements???? Never heard of that. Not for me, our children nor anyone in our large extensive family. Same thing for “college graduation”. The students tell the parents the particulars and get any required tickets and then a determination is made if any grandparents can attend or siblings. Period. That is it. And afterwards you have a small party for family who live close by, Maybe. No one (No One) should be hinting for or looking for Presents related to graduation. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We never had “security” at any high school that I attended. If there was a fight, then other students broke it up or the teachers waded in and wailed the Heck out of the miscreants. There is absolutely no need to have security. And No One was ever suspended or expelled from our high school, unless they were thrown into jail and couldn’t attend school. Security??? That is something that started in the 1990’s to appease all the helicopter parents. Let the teachers handle the idiots and there will be no problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I refer to all high school students as teenagers. Period. Technically they are only children to their parents. And then they will always be the children of their parents. In high school they are All legally Minors. So merely call them Teenagers and everyone will understand…… After high school, if they go into an apprenticeship or enlist in the military they are then Adults. If they go to college, refer to them as College Students. That is a much better lexicon and avoids problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have a boy who is a Sophomore in high school, influenced by all the juniors and seniors that surround him, taking your Eighth Grade daughter on a date????????? No. Period. And as the father of two boys, we would never permit our sons to do that. Dating in high school is fine, as long as both people are in high school And show a sufficient level of maturity……. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately you will Not be able to explain it to the colleges. You may Note what you said. However, no admissions officer will believe you, unless your statement is Substantiated in the cover letter of recommendation that accompanies your official transcript and is written by either your guidance counselor or your headmaster. That mandatory letter will describe you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person. Have a very long and polite discussion about this with your guidance counselor. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clothing of their choice for the USA. There was No need for anyone in our large extended family to attend a Private school. We all attended Public schools and did fine (I was accepted early action at MIT) and having a nice selection of suitable clothing for school was easy to assemble and cost-effective. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Competitive cheer is one of the most difficult of all of the sports. It is a combination of gymnastics and synchronized dance. And competitive cheer has one of the highest incidences of concussions, second only to tackle football. (Based on a per person per minute ratio). If you miss a routine, you can injure someone or even turn them into a quadriplegic. See the Netflix true-reality mini-series: Cheer Good luck as you will need it.

<|startoftext|>For what purpose are you changing your name? You will have to go through a court procedure (USA) to change your name. Is Lukas your middle name? Because I know a lot of people who go by their Middle name. Or, make Lukas your Nick Name. There are people called by their nickname all the time. my brother started to use a nickname at age 3 and no one (No One) ever called him by his true first name, only by his nickname. Even in the US Navy, everyone called him by his own given nickname. So, make Lukas your nickname and go for it. But Ethan will still be on your drivers license and passport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is your father. I hope you know him by now…… Was it a one time ever accident? Is your father getting forgetful as he gets older? Does your father normally store his guns in an approved Safe? If the guns are not normally stored in a safe, then that would be the Last time I would allow my child to visit by himself and stay overnight. Period. Otherwise, you have to evaluate what you know about your father over time and now and make an informed decision. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very interesting question. The vast majority of nations around the world discriminate against women in some manner, shape or form. Either that, or the Women’s World Cup would be much larger and more competitive….. as one example…… I would not tour a country during which my presence would add to the discrimination of women or somehow assist in supporting the discrimination of women. Or I might have to limit the areas I visit. For example, I would not visit any ultra-orthodox areas of Israel. Just one example. The nation could have a female leader, but in some regions/areas be highly discriminant of women….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are a resident of Texas, you need to READ everything here: How to apply for a Texas Driver License And you will learn that if you are between 18 and 25 years old and have never had a drivers license, then you will need to do the things listed there.

Everyone, at some point, in the USA, must take a written test before being issued a drivers license.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, you are 13 years too late…….. If he wants to leave, he will leave, because over the last 13 years, you have been a buddy and not a parent……… Just based upon what I see around me with other families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late August or early September 2020. There is No vaccine available for the COVID-19 virus The virus is still prevalent and just as virulent as ever. Children go to school and “hang all over each other”. It is what children do. From age 3 to 18….. Social distancing when the children out number the adults by a Huge margin will become non-existent. The children will catch the virus and for the most part be asymptotic and merely spread the virus. The older teachers and staff and administrators will catch the virus and then the death rate will start up…. Children will return home to parents or if their parents work, possibly to grand parents, and those older people will catch the virus and the death rate will ratchet upwards. There is a rogue wave lurking out there. And if we are not careful that COVID-19 will come back in a second wave like a Tsunami……. It was the Second Wave of the 1919 flu pandemic that killed the bulk of the 50 MILLION people world wide, when the Earth had only 25% of the current population…… It is a ticking time bomb. Welcome to the ocean and watch out for rogue waves…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably because the average home owner has problems dealing with small numbers or percentages. Let us assume that your house is worth $250,000 and the tax rate is 1%. In “mills”, that is $10 per $1,000 in value. So, with mills that is 250 thousands times $10 or $2,500. Where as in percentage, the person has to know that 1% is 0.01 and then they may lose one of the decimal places…… Otherwise $250,000 times 0.01 is $2,500. I could care less. However, many people get confused with “percentage” and prefer “whole numbers”. Just my take on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like you are in a Heap of Trouble: Indeed, it sounds like you had a “Failure to Communicate” with your parents. You reap what you sow. And it sounds like you sowed some really bad seeds that are sprouting this Summer and now you have to deal with them. You will need to regain the trust of your parents. Without the phone. Without the car. And without those two slices of plain white bread toast…… Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No extracurricular activities? Nothing. You do nothing external to the school curriculum? Nothing with others. You merely go to school, take courses, go home and study and repeat day after day after day? An extracurricular activity Could be something you do in school outside of the class room and the curriculum. However, I and many did a lot Outside of School in our extended local community that allowed us to work with others and to help others. There must be Something…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same as high school students do, except, Hopefully with a lot more maturity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Define: Live in different countries…… It is easy to walk from San Diego to Tijuana. Trivial to walk from El Paso to Juarez. etc. It is easy to go back and forth across the border of Switzerland and Italy.

<|startoftext|>In Massachusetts that would be Excise tax and you are billed annually by the town or city in which you live (and have the car registered for an address). It may take the town a few months to send you the first bill, but they will only give you 30 days to pay.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not unless you need to rent a car……………………………… When my wife and I took our sons to college, the college was a six hour drive away (320 miles). We needed to carry the three of us and all of each of our freshman sons “stuff”. I rented, from Hertz, either a mini-van or a large SUV for $50 per day (including tax) and unlimited miles. We stayed over night. We rented for three days for $150. The wear and tear on our Car (which was too small for the task) would have been 640 miles times 50 cents per mile, or $320. I definitely believe that the $150 for the rental was Cheap……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the ride gets us to the airport late, then my buddies and I will tip the cab over at least 90 degrees. However, assuming everything is smooth with the ride, I will tip the cab Driver 25%. Don’t forget that many times they have to leave the airport empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Competitive cheer is probably one of the hardest, if not the hardest sport. It is a combination of high intensity gymnastics and dance in a team coordinated fashion. One person screws up and someone is injured, killed or made a quadriplegic for life. One of the highest rates of concussions is in competitive cheer. Go on Netflix and watch the six-part mini-series called Cheer and you will understand. If you are brimming with energy and looking for something to do, then go out for either cross-country or outdoor track & field. Both of those are No Cut sports as long as you attend every practice and meet unless excused by the coach. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was five years old I walked a half mile to Kindergarten and then a half mile home. And, several of my classmates, at age 5, walked almost two miles each way, crossing two major streets. So, a four year old Should be able to walk at Least a half-mile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Professional athletes, to me, are those who make the bulk of their annual income from playing that sport. Therefore, how willing are the athletes to “stay in the bubble”? And what bubble is being provided? For example, NBA and NHL are having an end-of-season bubble at a given location, and it is expected that the players will remain there. For that, it is likely it will work. Whereas Major League Baseball and American Football are not having a team bubble, and I believe that it is highly likely that the seasons will Fold (be cancelled) with 2020. I personally, don’t believe that professional team sports can truly make it back until June of 2021 (just prior to the Summer Olympics) Whereas individual sports like tennis and golf and bowling are back and will probably be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being in a car will be analogous to being in an elevator: Everyone wears a mask No one speaks (unless absolutely necessary) However, in a car you can all open the windows and get lots of air exchanged, or run the air conditioning unit with recirculation Turned Off, so that only fresh air is cooled and brought into the car. Travel only with people that you know or trust. Be wary about Uber/Lyft and taxis If you have to get from Point A to Point B and the only logical way to do so is to be inside of a car, then either you drive alone or you ride with someone that you “trust”, but wear masks and no talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, if you are over 18 years old, then go to the local police department, explain the situation and get a police officer to accompany to your parents home so that you can Quickly get your possessions and leave. NOTE: They must be Your possessions, not items that your parents were Loaning to you. Of course, in the USA, if you are under 18 years old, and go to the local police, then your parents will be in a Heap of Trouble…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is one of the many factors you Must consider when having a family in the USA. In the USA, it is Expected that the parents will be the First source of funding for college, second is the student, third is the Federal and State governments, fourth are the colleges and last is borrowing. We planned on having two children for many reasons. Financially, affording children for the first 23 years of their lives, was one of those considerations. And the more children that you have, the bigger the home you may need, and what is the impact on your family cars? And cost of food and clothing and family vacations? How big is big? I know plenty of families that have 3 or 4 children and (recently) were able to afford to assist each child in attending college. Space them out about 2 years apart. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question. You will need (if you have them): Birth Certificate Social Security Card Drivers license Passport Record of immunizations High School Diploma College Diploma You may not have some of those, but the birth certificate and the social security card are Absolutely essential….. Or you do not exist per the USA government……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, you would go to the local police department, prove to them that you are only 17 years old and ask for assistance. If you are actually 18 or older, then you are on your own. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. It is Highly likely that sufficient vaccines will be available in 2021 to vaccinate all of the 5 to 25 year old students by mid-August 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children from the age of 5 to 18? Yes. Anyone older than 35 in the building? No. And those children should be kept in the school on cots in vacant spaces and return home at the end of the first term, so they don’t infect and kill-off their parents and other relatives. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be a top-student at a California community college (92% of accepted UCLA transfer students come from California community colleges). And be a top athlete at the community college and get recruited by a UCLA head coach. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA? No. In Canada? No. In Pakistan or India? No. Overall, in the world, on average? Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically in the first week of high school, those are the ones trapped inside their lockers or crawling out of the dumpsters behind the school. Then for the remainder of the first term, those are the ones looking very nervous when they are near their locker or the dumpsters. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not know any that did that, but I did know several who went to MIT at age 16, did well academically, but had socialization issues due to a lack of maturity. This was in the 1970’s. Only Half of a bachelors degree is learning the subject material. The other Half is supposed to be Maturing from a raw teenager into an adult along with the others in the undergraduate student community. However, if you are significantly younger than the others, that can lead to problems and depression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MIT And you can take courses at Harvard for free when you are at MIT. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had no concerns when they moved away for college. And then after college they got their own apartments and we never saw those apartments until many months later when we visited. If you work well with your children from the time they are born, and you work well with your children when they pack to go to summer camp ~11 years old for over night camp, and you work well together when you help them pack for lengthy family vacations and then later when they pack to head off to college, then there are no concerns. If you did your parenting job well for those first 18 years then their moving out on their own is Trivial with No concerns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a Catch-22 here for the USA. TSA states that minors, under the age of 18, do not need an ID to fly within the USA: Identification | Transportation Security Administration . And most if not all US airlines state that minors 15 to 17 years old can fly unaccompanied…… So, if a (for example) 17 year old minor wants to fly from Boston to Los Angeles, then how does that person convince the TSA agent that she/he is under the age of 18 and does not need an ID???????????????????????????????????????? One would need an ID to prove they are under the age of 18…………… If you are with your parents, then no ID is required. If you are attempting to fly alone…… you probably should have some form of ID with you. Many 16 year old people have at least a Learner’s Permit for driving and that, I believe, is a legal ID since the person goes through the entire ID process (including getting a picture taken) to get a learner’s permit. Otherwise, do you have a high school picture ID? Our sons both had passports by the time they were 10 years old. Everyone in the USA should have a passport….. My personal belief. It makes life much easier….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is how it worked at our home: We had multiple computers and laptops in the house, all connected to a in-home network with a back-up system. I was the administrator on every computer and the network. My wife was the back-up admin. All the computers were in Public areas within the house. There were quiet study areas for the boys but not in their bedrooms. Since the boys did not have admin-privileges, I had to install any new software and I could check any computer at any time. And of course, I had complete visibility into the internet traffic. Just like at any employer and just like at any college with internet access. There is an IT administrator who can See All. The boys got their own laptop computer when they graduated from high school and headed-off to college. They got their own cell phones when they graduated from college and could afford their own cell-phones and cell-phone plan (they got their own family-plan for the two of them). Simple. Our computers and cell phones and we had administrator privileges and also the password for each of the cell phones that the boys were Loaned to use. Be a Parent and not a buddy. Better you note their bad habits before they head off to college and get expelled for internet violations or get a job and then fired for internet violations….. Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You Broke the trust that your parents had in you. Now you must expend a Lot of time and Effort in regaining that trust. Until then you will just have to survive in high school without a cell phone as students have done for Hundreds and Thousands of years. Indeed, I pay close attention to our public school system and there is No requirement for a high school student to have a cell phone. If anything there is a requirement for the student to Not use the phone when in a restricted area or given specific permission to use the phone by a teacher or staff member.<|endoftext|>

As long as your employer needs you, you have a job. As long as you are doing your job well, you have a job.

Unless you have a written and signed contract, almost everyone is an employee at will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong question/hypothesis. The phone is taken away from the child and locked in the main office. The parent is contacted by the school and told to come and retrieve the phone. No running required. You calmly enter the building and sign-in as a visitor. Then you sign a piece of paper stating that you retrieved the phone that was confiscated from your child who disobeyed the rules that both You and the Child signed to obey at the beginning of each school year. Simple No running required.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dormitory is where you live. You shower and clean-up in your dorm, so, therefore, by definition, you are nude in the dorm. If the showers are “down the hall”, you at least wrap a towel around yourself when walking through the hallways or wear a robe. Simple. Dorms are Not nudist colonies. One does not routinely walk around the dorm nude. However, while showering or getting dressed for the day or preparing for bed each night, you will be nude for some amount of time. Just like in every home or apartment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plan? You won’t like my plan…… Public school students Move Into the schools starting in very early September. They are NOT allowed to leave the school grounds until one of two things occurs: They contract the COVID-19 virus and completely recover It is time for Winter break and they test negative for the virus. The towns/cities set-up cots in the gyms and auditoriums and spare rooms. Army style tent structures can be set-up on the playing fields. Parents stay at home. Students are locked-down in school, paid for by the taxpayers. Teachers and staff and administrators must test each morning on arrival and each evening on departure. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not truly certain what your question is really asking. However, from my knowledge, in the USA, close to 100% of the US professional athletes played varsity sports in high school. However, on the flip side, less than one percent of high school varsity players ever make it to the professional level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Massachusetts you do. Your parents must sign a permission slip before the start of Every season of any sport. You must have an annual sports-physical with your medical doctor. You must participate in an annual concussion awareness program. And in most school systems it will cost ~$200 to play a sport each and every season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are. Many airlines will allow children under the age of 2 years old to fly for Free if they sit on their parent’s lap. And, anything else is discriminatory. If you don’t want any children on your flight, then charter an aircraft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really a “house rule”, but the opposite. One of my friends, in elementary school, during the summer was Not allowed in his house between breakfast and dinner. He had to wander the neighborhood to find places to play and to scrounge for lunch. He spent many a lunch time at my house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming you are asking about attending college in one of those two cities, then the answer is Boston. Boston area has a Huge number of colleges, including some of the best in the world. Whereas for Las Vegas you are really only looking at two US public colleges in the region. Of course, if you want to major in hotels and hospitality, then the epicenter for that is Las Vegas, and if you can put together a Co-Op program with University of Las Vegas then go for it. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have to ask, then you probably know that your parents do Not trust you enough to have a sleep-over. Build their trust in you. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe, and maybe not. Cross country, indoor track and outdoor track are three different sports for example, and typically are No Cut. As long as you like to run, and show up at every practice and meet unless excused by your coach, you are on the team. And you could be the slowest runner in your region…… What impresses the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League is: Excellent student What do You offer to the undergraduate student community at that college Outside of the classroom. Well what do you offer to a typical student at an elite private US college? If you are playing a sport they love a Real captain of a varsity team and someone who is not just a team All-Star but is a regional or state all-star. The best of the best of the best. That is what they are looking for. Remember, UCLA and UC Berkeley combined, those two colleges have More students together than the combination of the eight colleges of the Ivy League, plus MIT, plus Caltech, and plus Stanford. The best of the best of the best.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Start a school…… In 1997 the Olin Foundation decided to start a college for 400 STEM students and they needed an initial $300 Million and readily available land from Babson College. To start your own small private high school for 500 students, you would probably need at least $1 million for the land, then another $80 million for the building. For $100,000 you might be able to start a small day-care center or if you rented a church basement then possibly a small pre-school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe you mean the MIT RSI: Research Science Institute If you go to the web site you will see a video with RSI attendees from around the world. Then click on the application tab and you will note that there is a whole section on international applicants. Good luck for the Summer of 2021 or beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do what I did that assisted me in getting admitted to MIT early action: At age 16 I got a part-time (14 hours each weekend and full-time in the Summer) job at a local McDonald’s. STEM? Making French Fries quickly starting from the Potato, having to operate an automatic peeling machine, then washing and blanching the potato cuts and then frying to the correct level. Filling and repairing the milkshake machine, and then only the best get to work with and repair the high pressure carbonated beverage system. That is what colleges want: practical hands-on experience with equipment and the ability to work well with others in a team-like fashion. Head over to your local fast-food restaurant and get the experience that impresses colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most if not all of the US colleges are “betting” that it will Many have informed the students who will be allowed to return to show up a week early and there will be No holidays during the first term and the first term will end before the Thanksgiving break. Some colleges will continue for a week or two after Thanksgiving online only with online final exams and the others will have final exams before Thanksgiving. Then everyone is off until the start of second (Spring) term. And since not all college students are being allowed back to campus there will be empty dorms set aside for the recuperation of the students who do contract the virus. But don’t worry the death rate for the 5 to 25 year old people is about 1 out of 10,000 which is the same as it was for measles prior to the introduction of a measles vaccine in 1963. And the current college suicide rate is 1.2 out of 10,000 or higher…… What do colleges know? They believe that a second wave is gathering, and that by December 2020 it will be a Tsunami. Good-bye older professors and parents…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy scout camp. Large tents with cots, at least perched on a wooden platform….. I went to camp (early 1960’s) wondering: “How does the bugler get up each morning to sound reveille?” At the beginning of the second week at camp, I got my answer. I was selected to wake-up the bugler each morning of that week………………….. Oh great…… A lot of sleepless nights…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? We all know that 99% of the school bus drivers are under the age of 35 years old, so they will remain asymptomatic as well. No? And many of the drivers work for a 3rd party which probably considers them a 1099 gig worker and you are on your own…. Now we are all starting to see what will happen when public schools reopen at the end of August and the older teachers, staff, administrators, bus drivers, janitors, lunch service workers, security, etc. are exposed by all of the under 18 asymptomatic children who have not been isolating this summer (we have all seen them frolicking with their friends)….. Second wave is Gathering off-shore, and it will be a Tsunami……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neighbors will complain. You go back to NY or NJ or CT from your winter home in Florida that is experiencing increasing cases of the COVID-19 virus and your neighbors see you wandering around the neighborhood or in a local store or restaurant, they will be calling the police. Just order some food from a grocery delivery service and stay in your house and yard for the next 14 days. Simple. The alternative is Rykers Island for isolation….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why wait? Most Masters student applications must be submitted by early March. Submit your application for Masters and if admitted, then you can continue to work through the summer of 2021 on the OPT associated with your Masters degree program……… Speak with your DSO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vast majority of students in the UC system are residents of California, and if you are a resident, then ask your high school guidance counselor about your case. The counselor knows you and how you compare to others from the public school who preceded you and were admitted to an UC campus. If you are not a resident of California, then why do you want to pay almost $75,000 per year to an attend an UC campus with almost No Hope of any financial aid from the UC system? If you can get admitted to UC Berkeley or UCLA as an out-of-state applicant, then you stand a chance with a very good private US college that will offer you financial aid. Think through this very seriously. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You pay it. Indeed, you pay it as quickly as possible. Go to the US Post Office and get a money order and pay the ticket. In many states, and NY is one of them, the local state police barracks are located in small “poor” towns. The towns make their money by having the state police issue tickets (for real speeding violations) and then the ticket is paid to a local court….. If you pay the ticket within the stated time frame, that is it. It may never get reported to Albany (State Capitol) and therefore may never get sent to your state’s DMV or RMV. However, if you think you can avoid paying, you are wrong. The ticket will eventually get sent to the state’s RMV or DMV and a late fee will be applied and then the ticket will be sent to your state’s DMV/RMV and it will then count against your auto insurance (and that will be three or more times the cost of the ticket), and you will not be able to renew your drivers license or possibly re-register your car until the ticket is paid, in full and the late fees could double or triple the price of the ticket. You can easily turn a $150 speeding violation into over $1,000 in cost to you. PAY the ticket and use a US postal money order. Simple. And the US postal service makes some money on the transaction and you are supporting some poor town in a local state. Win- win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fairly easy if you enlist in the US military. I have a professional colleague who was an enlisted member of the USAF. He showed promise and the USAF paid for his bachelors degree and made him an officer. Then with more excellent work, the USAF sent him on assignment to AFIT to earn a masters degree. Then several more years of excellent work at an USAF engineering site, and the USAF deployed him to UC Berkeley to earn his PhD in nuclear physics. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly. Demonstrate that you have a college level command of the British language. Simple. You could do that by demonstrating that you did your last 3 to 4 years of education all in the British language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you are making a statement in the form of a question which is reportable, because you have Not cited a reputable web site that supports your statement. William O. Beeman - Wikipedia So, I will report as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I graduated high school in 1969 and earned my bachelors degree in 1973. One constant throughout those eight years of schooling was the Vietnam War and the continual TV showing of the daily carnage and the increasingly violent protests. That was paralleled with the many race riots across the USA and with the assassination of three national leaders. For me there were the War protests in Boston, the National Guard assassinating unarmed students at Kent State (where friends of mine were students), Colleges across the USA gong on strike to protest the Kent State killings, the police and national guard running rampant through African-American students at Southern colleges, and finally a war protest march to Harvard Square from Boston that the local police decided to halt in front of the MIT campus. Tear gas flowing and baton swinging police chasing people across the MIT campus. I guess all of that was relatively normal for that time period…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the USA The NFL allows ties after an additional 15 minutes of play. Baseball and softball are sports for which there is never a tie. Basketball is easy to have a tie-breaker Ice hockey is easy to have a tie-breaker. Soccer is such a low scoring game that it will only bore people to death to continue to play. Simple. Professional sports are Entertainment. The fans in the USA love to have a game go into overtime and see a victor emerge if possible. I love soccer, but I hate the concept of playing for a tie. Boring and the Italian national team used to bore people with it for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently (and for the last many years) very few jobs in the USA have a pension. Therefore, here is what I recommended to our sons who graduated college in 2013 and 2014 and started working in their careers: Pay off their student loans (each had $25K in loans) within five years, Always pay your credit card statement in Full each and every month, Determine what your expenses are for an entire year. Make certain you always have a cash reserve of Half of that (6 month reserve) minimum. Invest as soon as possible in your company’s 401K plan. The first Ten Percent of your gross income that you invest in the 401K is your “pension”. Everything Above 10% is your actual “extra or 401K”. Hopefully your company will match a good portion of what you invest Do not have children until you have completed the bulk of your education, feel comfortable in your career and are financially stable to support a family Be frugal. Do you have what you need, and do you need what you have? Use common sense. Shop wisely. Similarly on vacations and take vacations. That’s it. That is all that is necessary to be financially set for retirement. Enjoy life, your career and your family and friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poorly worded question. Almost every US college has intramural sports and the D-league is for students who can’t walk and chew gum at the same time…… However, if you mean Varsity sports, that is different. I did what you asked. I played no sports for my high school nor for a local amateur team while I was in high school. But I played pick-up sports with all my friends, and “whipped my sorry butt into shape” in the summer before starting at MIT and was the last freshman selected for the intercollegiate soccer team. And then later, as a graduate student, I became fanatic at ice hockey goaltending and made the club-varsity team as a back-up goaltender. So, yes, at many NCAA D-3 colleges, if you didn’t play formal sports in high school there is still a chance for someone who truly “whips their sorry butt into shape” to make a college team. And if not that, then there is always the D-league in intramural sports but watch out for those gum chewers…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA you are a Minor under the age of 18. You can Not get a learner’s permit for driving without your parent assisting you. However, if you have a drivers license at age 17, then that is your ID. You can Not get a passport without assistance from your parent: 16 and 17-year-olds applying for a passport can do it by themselves if they have their own identification documents. A parent will need to do one of the following: Provide a signed, notarized statement saying they know that their child is seeking a passport or Attend the appointment with them However, my sons got their passports before they were ten years old (everyone should). And if you have an US passport then that is a “real ID” and accepted every where. But if you do not have a drivers license or a passport, then you are out of luck…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those comments come from the elite Private US colleges and not the much, much larger Public universities. UC Berkeley or UCLA each have over 30,000 undergraduate students. Those combined 60,000 undergraduate students are more than the eight of The Ivy Athletic League, MIT, and Stanford combined. Those Public college are meant to serve the residents of their state. And with the normal diversity in the residents of California, one will get a diverse undergraduate student community at either UCLA or Berkeley, especially with the huge number of students. Whereas, a place like MIT or Harvard or Stanford with 4,500 to 7,000 undergraduate students total (each) and with a worldwide reach for students, then it is much better to get a very diverse applicant pool and then look to make the undergraduate community reasonably diverse. Note: Caltech has less than 1000 total undergraduate students and focuses solely on STEM. People attend MIT to major in business or economics or political science but not so with Caltech (undergraduate level). Therefore, Caltech focuses mostly on STEM and does try to get students who will resonate well together as part of their tiny undergraduate community. I hope this explains in quantitative manner with a few qualitative overtones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is exactly the decision I had to make when I started at MIT as a freshman in the Fall of 1969. I entered MIT thinking I would major in nuclear physics, but I also loved aeronautical engineering. However, one enters MIT as a freshman with No major. I took a seminar as a freshman in Elementary Particle Physics (thinking it was elementary, but it was an advanced assessment of elementary particles…..). I did fine, but then questioned my interest in nuclear physics. I then took a seminar in aircraft design in the Spring and found my Love in Applied Physics or otherwise called Engineering. I then went on to major in Aero-Astro at MIT and continued on at MIT as a graduate student. Loved it!!! Therefore, apply to colleges that have Both physics and aero-astro engineering. Then if you change your mind, you can merely and easily change majors and not have to transfer colleges. There are relatively few colleges in the USA and worldwide that have a dedicated Aero-Astro Engineering major or dedicated niche within Mech Engineering. Use this list as a starting point: List of aerospace engineering schools - Wikipedia scroll up/down for other countries. You should Never have to select a major before applying to college. Before sophomore year in college is fine. And any college with a decent engineering program will have a good physics department. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sounds dumb to me, from someone who thinks they could go to college….. 20% of the people who have a PhD degree in the USA attended a community college for some portion of their college education. Therefore you want to live on your own and not on campus? Simple. Attend a local community college for two years, do really well and for most states and maybe all states you are guaranteed to become a junior in your state’s top public university system. And transferring in as a junior means you most likely (and in your case definitely) would live off-campus in a rental unit. Simple, even for a high school student who believes they are ready for college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>International student? You may not be able to do that. Check with your college’s DSO. It has helped some people to over come depression of one type or another. I know an US citizen who withdrew from MIT for a term and took courses at a local community college (getting all A grades and totally distorting the grading curve) and then returned to MIT refreshed and ready to “soldier on”. But, that person did Not do it for cost. And it may be un-doable by an international student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone who watches movies starring Jennifer Lawrence (a high school drop out) or Tom Cruise (among many others) care what their high school grades were? Do you care what the high school grades were of a famous chef? When you go to the opera or the ballet do you care about the grades those singers and dancers had in high school? And that goes on and on and on. Lebron James, who cares what his high school grades were? And you shouldn’t either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My rough “guess”. If the Earth’s orbit was 5% closer to the Sun than it currently is, the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth would be 10% greater (watts/square-meter) and the Earth’s climate would soon become uninhabitable. The average orbital radius is 93 million miles and the Earth’s diameter is about 8000 miles. 5% is 4.65 million miles closer or ~582 Earth diameters closer….. Just my gut feel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First you have asked this same question two different ways. PLEASE delete that other question. Secondly, Robotics requires a Mechanism to work autonomously. Therefore, you have electronics and computers and guidance and control, BUT deep down, it is still a Mechanism. Some people have “created” the concept of Mechatronics, but real STEM colleges like CMU and MIT, etc do not need a new short-hand. Robotics Take a look (link above) at the Robotics in the Mechanical Engineering department of CMU. Do you want to be “in charge” of the entire robotic system? If yes, then you need some grounding or foundation in mechanical engineering since a robot is a Mechanism that requires guidance and control but you need to understand the fundamentals of how the mechanism functions in order to control it. Notice the “mech” part of both??? If you are truly drawn to robotics then major in Mechanical Engineering with the niche in robotics and take extra courses in Guidance and Control which will require some knowledge of computer science and electrical engineering. You don’t have to double major, just follow the prescribed program and Add courses of interest to you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people in the USA have been traveling outside the USA or have recently be allowed to return to the USA after being locked-down in another country. It is a simple and perfectly logical question to ask.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What???????????????????? It is June 24th, 2020 and we (the entire WORLD) are in the midst of a six-month old PANDEMIC. You have heard of COVID-19 and the DEATH RATE for older people (maybe your parents are in that age range). Your travel with your boy friend may result in you getting the virus (20% probability) and if you get it you are in an age group with a 1 out of 10,000 death rate (the same as the current suicide rate on college campuses or the death rate for your age group for measles prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1963…) Whereas if you return home with the virus and are (likely) asymptomatic, then your parents may have a 40% chance of catching the virus and a 20% or higher DEATH RATE. ISOLATE until a vaccine is widely available. Or Move out and in with your boy friend. Simple. Try to be intelligent about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. You have two options: Sign a one year (12 month lease) (for example) for $1,000 per month Or rent the apartment on a month by month basis for $1,100 per month In the first case, you are guaranteed to pay only $1,000 per month and the owner is guaranteed to get paid $1,000 per month for 12 months Whereas in the second case, you can move out at any time. Therefore, for that flexibility, you are paying an extra $100 per month. So, in my example, if you fully believe you will live in that apartment for 10 months or Less, then do the month-by-month lease. Of course, the landlord can also cancel your lease at the end of each month (with 30 days notice, typically). So, unless you only plan on living in that apartment for 6 months or less, I would get the one year lease. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two things to consider: First you are probably using a bank in your country, so speak with the management of your bank to determine if they have any branches in the USA or any relationships with banks in the USA that would make fund transfers “less expensive”. Second, many colleges have a bank that works with the college. That bank will easily accept freshmen as new customers of the bank and you will have your passport and college ID for identification. That bank will have a branch office on the campus and ATMs around the campus. Additionally, some colleges have an arrangement with the bank so that your college ID becomes your ATM card (with a detailed PIN). That bank will typically offer these free services: You get a “checking account” with no checks but tied to your ATM card, you get a savings account and you get a credit card. All are tied together, so it is easy to log-in online to the bank and pay your credit card statement (ALWAYS in full) using electronic fund transfer for free. Double check with your college in California and see if they have an arrangement with a bank. NOTE: You should arrive at the college and then at the bank with something like American Express Travelers Cheques to provide you with “cash” that you can use for your initial deposit into the US bank. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To move out on your own at age, you would need at Least $4,000 in savings and being hired to a $13 per hour (minimum) job for 40 hours per week. Over 3.5 years you should be able to save $100 per month by refereeing/umpiring youth sports and/or baby sitting, taking care of neighbors’ pets, neighborhood lawn mowing and snow shoveling and leaf raking, etc. Then when you are 16 years old, you can get a job at a fast food restaurant for $10 per hour. Easy. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are creating the potential for a transfer between two colleges by applying to Columbia University. Same would be true for Cornell. Instead, check on Dartmouth, Brown, and Princeton where there is very good engineering in addition to the liberal arts centered majors in the Same college and it is trivial to switch majors in the same college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most likely the SAT exams are documents under a copyright. It is permissible to quote (exactly) copyrighted material in part as long as you note author and source of the material. However, if you were to post an entire or a major portion of a specific SAT exam online, then you would be in violation of the copyright and could be sued (and would be). Single question with proper marking and reference is fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am certain that an elite private college like MIT will sneer at anyone who tries to get course credit with the 2020 AP test results. Be prepared to take a one-hour MIT exam to get that credit, and possibly a 3 hour exam. MIT will give you at least 24 hours notice. Enjoy the experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have known a number of people who started at MIT at age 16. The two that I knew quite well (a room mate and a lab mate) both had “issues” later having started college before they were really mature enough for that. (Late 1960’s when they started). However, because the USA has become horribly litigious over the last 40 years or so, and because the suicide rate is near the maximum for that age group (1.2 out of 10,000 which is higher than the pre-vaccine death rate for measles and the current death rate for COVID-19 for this age group), the elite private colleges like MIT will look very closely at the person’ Maturity level. And, if the person (today) starts college prior to age 18, the parents may have to sign a waiver, and if the student starts college at 16 or younger (certainly 15 or younger) the college may require the student to live at home with their parents and that may required the family to relocate to that college area……. That recently happened to a young student who started at Cornell, but his entire family had to relocate to Ithaca, NY….. Try to start college at age 17 or older if at all possible, because when you are on-campus 24x7 with no family close by, that can be a real shock to the child’s un-mature system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My father had one of those. It was 8 am to 4:30 pm with a one hour lunch break. Some places may have a 9 am to 5 pm with a half-hour lunch break. It can vary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As with anything like this, you really need to speak with the Athletic Director at your new college. Because it is more than just the NCAA. League rules take precedence over NCAA rules if the league rules are more severe. For example, if you went from Williams College (D-3) to Harvard (D-1), you would need to check the transfer restrictions for The Ivy Athletic League, which the Harvard AD could rattle off forwards and backwards. But in general, if you transfer up, you do not need to sit out a season. And if you did sit out (to focus on academics this first term at the new college), then you get five years from when you first matriculated to college and started classes (after having completed high school). Therefore the five year clocked started at the beginning of your freshman year at the NCAA D3 college, and nothing stops that clock. However, one can seek a waiver, see your AD. (NOTE: waiver rules many times a very strict within the league and The Ivy Athletic League is very strict, for example).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From what I have seen over the many years: Men and women can be Suite mates. However, males and females are Not assigned to the same bedroom. Of course, there are ways around that, and once you are assigned to a room in a dorm, one could swap rooms with others on that same dorm floor (for example) and arrange whatever you like, especially as a sophomore or junior or senior. I could be wrong, but I doubt that. I can Not imagine any US college assigning males and females to the same Bedroom. However, at many US college, you will find males and females in the same bedroom as consenting adults….. But not assigned there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is on the high side for a first term freshman. 15 is normal on average and taking at least 12 is expected. 17 credits means you will spend 17 hours per week in class, lab or recitations. Then expect a Minimum of twice that for home work, and studying or an Additional (minimum) of 34 hours per week. That could be a lot while you are still trying to acclimate yourself to living on your own away from home. On the other hand there are 168 hours in every week, and if you can manage them very well, then those 17 units will be fine. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a social security number, then you can create your own account at the Social Security Administration’s web site: my Social Security | SSA And when you do that, they will make you jump through hoops you never imagined.

The type of car you owned in the 1970’s, etc. And they will ask you all sorts of penetrating questions to verify your identity and then Mail (US Postal Service) your ID and one-time password to your account. Once you have an account, you will have access to all of the records that SSA has on you, and you can use their calculator to determine your monthly check from SS when you wish to start collecting (at age 62 or later). Enjoy the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had room mates for many years. It was easy and we really didn’t need to think much about it: Everyone took care of their own area (bedroom and any other individual area). Everyone took care of the bathrooms that they used. Period. Everyone took care of a shared area like the kitchen. If you do something in the kitchen you clean-up Immediately or within a very reasonable period of time. One did Not touch nor consume other people’s food. Unless invited to cook and share shopping together. It just works. Be nice, use common sense and be respectful. Simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Professional sports? Yes. In the USA, the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and MLS players are all well paid for their full-time (in season) sports. They can isolate with their team for 4 to 7 months and just play. Not so simple, but doable. College sports with Student-athletes? No. The COVID-19 will ravage the players, coaches, trainers and referees…… because no one is truly full-time and they won’t be isolated.<|endoftext|>

All those players (at least 45), coaches, trainers, support staff per team, two teams, plus 7+ referees, plus TV crews…… And what do all of those people do between games? I believe several of those games will be postponed/cancelled because members of the team (players, coaches, trainers, etc) tested positive for the virus on a Friday when they arrive at the practice site for Sunday’s game….. It may very well be a huge mess…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general that is how the USA was developed over the years. People immigrated to the USA, got jobs and settled down. And that does not depend upon someone being liberal, conservative or moderate. It is the process. First you have to be accepted into a Masters program. Then you have to get a F-1 student visa. Then you have to do well in your Masters program, and then you need to get a job using OPT time, then get a H-1B visa and while working, have the employer petition the US government to allow you to receive permanent resident status. That is one path in that process. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What is the alternative? If you are in the USA and have been accepted to a college, and do not have chance for a full-time job, then attend the college. The beginning of the Fall term of 2020 should be OK and many colleges will finish the first term completely before the Thanksgiving break and you will not return to campus until the start of the 2nd term or like MIT, all classes will revert to online for the one or two weeks after Thanksgiving, you will take online final exams and you will not return to campus until the start of the 2nd term. There is an outside chance that there will be sufficient vaccines available for students in the USA (ages 5 -25) by early 2021. And, most people expect the Fall of 2021 to be much more normal. So, unless you have an excellent alternative to attending college, Just Do It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are risking a lot by doing that. First there is No reason that 17 year old couldn’t have a learners permit. None. Get a permit. Second, one can drive with a permit, in the USA, if the front seat passenger is a licensed Adult (over the age of 21). Period. An 18 year old does Not count. If the police stop you for any reason, then there is trouble for both of you. Not worth it. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excuses? There are No excuses. You have to tell them what you Accomplished in that gap and you must have that substantiated in the many letters of recommendation that are submitted to the colleges on your behalf. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to travel, but do Not feel totally safe traveling. Not for business and not for vacation. Not until there is a set of vaccines that are readily available. If you are younger than 25, go for it, you most likely will be fine, but you might infect others. If you are over 60 years old, then travel could be a death sentence. Let that all sink in. Then try to stay close to home for at least the next nine months….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why??? I just bought a new car and within the required 7 days (keeping our oold license plate), the car was registered, inspected and then five days later the Title arrived in the mail. Everything is online. The DMV or RMV (depending upon the state), the dealer and the insurance companies are all online. It is trivial. Of course, if you are buying a car in a private deal, then all bets are off, and you need to get assistance from your insurance company.

<|startoftext|>Within the 48 contiguous states and I believe within the 50 states and Washington DC, all one needs is an official state ID or US passport or passport card. Soon one will need a Real ID and again each state issues that. However a passport or passport card always works. That is why our sons had passports before they were 10 years old, and then they both got drivers licenses before starting college. A state issued drivers license does the trick. If you can’t get a drivers license then many states have the equivalent in a state issued ID. If you are visiting the USA from another country, then you will have a passport. Simple. EVERY US citizen should have a Passport. Period. Eventually not having one will come to haunt you……<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First, I am trying to comprehend why a Public university like SUNY Buffalo would care. Second, no, a legacy is someone whose parents or possibly grandparents attended that college. You can mention that an aunt or uncle or sibling attended and that will tell the college that you understand more about it. Legacy, to me, infers parents or grandparents who attended that college and who are now Wealthy and/or Powerful. That is what the college is looking for: large donations or some leverage with the local, state or federal government.<|endoftext|>

Therefore, every concussion is a “brain injury” Here is one report: NFL says player concussions dropped by 29 percent in 2018 regular season I have seen numbers like 0.49 concussions per game. I am not certain if they are only counting concussions suffered in games or also including concussions suffered during practices. A better metric would be concussions per playing/practice minute. Therefore you would take the total of all of the concussions and divide by the total player-minutes involved including on-field practice and game time. Then you could compare concussion rates among: NFL, NHL, NBA, MLS, MLB, and the various female team sports and similarly for the comparative NCAA varsity sports and high school varsity sports. That would be a real number to compare.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Officials including police, ask children questions all the time. However, for the USA (state by state) it is illegal to interrogate a minor (under the age of 18) without some suitable adult present with the minor.

<|startoftext|>Personally, neither I nor anyone in my large extended family has witnessed a “broken public school system.” However, none of us live in a large Urban area, where schools spend more money on Transportation (busing) than they seemingly do on real education. And I don’t believe the continuing success of our many great colleges in the USA is any indication of a failing public school system. Those are selective battles that must be fought by each state, by the society, government and the people who want a better education system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the community service is a Requirement for graduation or Highly recommended for graduation, then it does Not count to the colleges. Then the volunteering is Co-Curricular (part of the curriculum) and not extracurricular (external to the curriculum). And for extracurricular activities that involve volunteering, it is not the number of Hours, but how you interacted with other people, showed team work and leadership and Accomplished something. You describe it and then get it substantiated in one of the several letters of recommendation that are submitted to colleges on your behalf. Remember that your guidance counselor (or headmaster) will submit a cover-letter-of-recommendation along with your official transcript and that will describe you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person (including serious and useful volunteering).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have an excellent professional relationship with your junior and senior year professors in college and of course with your graduate level professors.

One phone call from the head of my department and this one professor, and I was driving across country the next day to work at North American Rockwell. Same as a graduate student. As I was finishing my thesis, my professor came to me and said: Go see XYZ, they used to be grad students in this lab and now have a successful business.

<|startoftext|>I believe most bachelor degree programs in education focus on some aspect of the K-12 foundation of the education for the students. Some of those may go on to teach at a community college. However, it is not clear to me that many college professors have course work in “education”. They learn from the good examples of the professors they had and from their colleagues. Where this may break-down, would be at the second tier public four-year colleges in the various states. Many of those professors, especially for the freshman and sophomore students should have some basic education background, but may not. My opinion only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the many public schools in Massachusetts that I am familiar with, there are: Middle school teams that focus on participation and training Sometimes more than one team for each of the boys and girls to accommodate the participation High school freshman teams that focus on participation and training Sometimes more than one team for each of the boys and girls to accommodate the participation High school JV teams that focus on training for the varsity team. May carry more than the necessary number of players. High school Varsity teams that focus on winning together as a well-functioning team That is the way it should be. It is a means to assist students in their attempt to make it to the top (Varsity) and to achieve the end-goal which is to be a better team player and win games as a team. Not everyone can make it to varsity. However, everyone, starting in middle school or at least as a freshman, can try. NOTE: Many high school track & field and cross country teams will carry as many players who come out to every practice and meet (unless excused by the head coach). Anyone who finishes in the top group of their event is “Varsity” and everyone else is JV. Everyone participates in home meets and the away team size is limited by the space on the bus or buses.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From an all-year around climate (living in Boston and knowing many of the cities along the East Coast of the USA), I would say Philadelphia area, including the near-by section of Delaware. Farther South can get quite humid in the Summer and also you get into Hurricane lanes. Farther North and the snow will inundate you in the Winter. And the suburbs of Philadelphia are quite nice (our two sons attended college, each about 10 miles outside of Philadelphia and graduating in 2013 and 2014). The region North of Baltimore to Philadelphia can be quite nice all year around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It depends. Here is an example from our two sons who graduated college in 2013 and 2014. They were in two different colleges, about 40 miles apart, on different sides of Philadelphia (about 10 miles each from the boundary of Philadelphia). Each of their colleges only provided three years of dorm living. So they each had to move off campus as seniors. However, they each had built very close friendships with peer students and they each had a group of 3 to 4 who wanted to live together, off-campus, as seniors. Each group spent about 6 months finding a living set-up off-campus. For one, it was much closer to his department buildings, for the other he was 2 miles farther away. They each had a One Year lease, that started July 1 and ran through June 30 and therefore, each spent the summer between junior and senior years near their college, working. It worked out, that for an academic year at their college, the cost of dorm room and food was $12,000. For the same $12,000 they each got the 12 months (full calendar year) (including utilities) at the off-campus location. If you don’t want to live near your college in the summer, then it is not for you. And most colleges require freshmen to live on campus, so you might as well live on campus for freshman and sophomore years, building a good relationship with peers and then make a decision to move off-campus, together, starting junior or senior year. NOTE: In both cases their group needed a Parent to co-sign the lease. In both cases, knowing all the boys, I volunteered to be the “stuckee….” It depends. It can work out Very well, like it did for our two sons, or it can be a disaster……. Wait until senior year….<|endoftext|>

And the 737 could have a two-person flight crew so the flight deck was different. Boeing did a very cost-effective design of the 737 using the 707 and 727 as starting points. The 757 gained from the 707/727/737 work (same passenger windows) and the 767 was the big leap forward with the twin aisle design learned from the 747. Boeing did just fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Huh? The child’s bedroom is Expected to be Neat. Period. End of discussion. There is No sneaking of food. They eat in the common areas of the home, including nice central study areas. If they need a snack in their bedroom they take it there and Clean Up afterwards. Period. Be a member of the household and not a pest., and you will be fine. And eat to be healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They used to be. In the late 1980’s MIT weighted the SAT Subject test scores Ten Times more heavily than the mere SAT/ACT test score. However, over time, it has all been watered down, and recently, MIT stated that they will No Longer even look at someone’s SAT Subject Test Scores. Period. But MIT still wants the SAT/ACT basic score and, if required, the TOEFL score, which can replace the SAT/ACT score. I cannot speak for other colleges. However, I do know that places like Harvard, which is liberal arts centered, want a person to take four years of a single foreign language (with literature) in high school, and if not, then to demonstrate their prowess by doing well on the SAT Subject test for that language…. Just as an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Passing grade. That would be a D. The student has to show some command of the subject matter in order to earn a C or higher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, you are at college A in the first semester, and want to apply to colleges B and C to start there the following Fall and repeat freshman year? Correct? However, at least half if not more of your complete application will be the cover letter from your high school guidance counselor which will accompany your official transcript to colleges B & C and what will that letter state? And what about the date of completion on your high school transcript? What will that indicate to colleges B and C’s admission staff? And what about those letters of recommendation from high school teachers? What will they state? And what about any supplemental letters of recommendation what will that state? And if you earned any credits at College A, they will all be lost. correct? So think this through, really, really hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At that age, the Invitation for you to accompany that other family on their vacation does NOT come from you nor your friend. If comes form your friend’s parents contacting your parents directly and have a long discussion of the planned trip, where it will be, what will be the supervision, etc. etc. etc. Then if your parents feel the other parents are trustworthy and you want to go on that trip, they will lay down a set of standards for you to follow. Simple. But first, your parents must Believe that you are trustworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as all of their “bills” are paid at the Bursar’s office, they will have full access to their official transcript. If they still owe the college money, then they do not have access to that transcript and then Yes, the credits are in limbo and not useful. So, If the expulsion was for poor academic performance, then how are all those D and F grades going to assist that student in the future? If the expulsion was for academic dishonesty or the harassment of another student or college staff member or for being convicted of a felony, that will be included on the official transcript (The reason the person was asked to leave the college). The person can then use that transcript to try and get credit for the courses at another college in order to earn a degree, but the explanation on the transcript may cause the other college not to admit that person as a transfer student. Therefore it depends. And it may take time before those credits will ever be useful again. Be wary, be very wary and focus on being a good person and a good student at college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?????????????? Every graduate student that I knew at MIT was quite friendly, professional and helpful. Indeed many of us went well out of our way to assist others in their research and especially in conducting difficult experiments. Science and Engineering is for Team Work. And the team work starts in graduate school if not during undergraduate studies (like it did at MIT). Choose your graduate program wisely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember refereeing a boys high school soccer game at the private boarding school: Concord Academy. There was Caroline Kennedy watching the game and her mother and step father Jacqueline (Kennedy) and Aristotle Onassis were visiting. I had a chance encounter and brief words (keeping one eye on the security staff.) What was Caroline supposed to do while her parents traversed the world on their own initiatives? Stay home (where ever that was) and have the house-staff make certain she got to school on time and supervised her studies? Have a long discussion with your parents (at which ever house you call home) and then take a long look at the family’s staff and decide if a great private boarding school isn’t better than the alternative…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Indeed, less than 7% of the residents of the USA are Asian-Americans and yet the undergraduate students at MIT and many of the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League are 20% Asian-American. Therefore, Asian-Americans are NOT under-represented minorities. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because it is an Athletic League. Period. End of Discussion. You can misuse the term or use the term with the “wink wink” meaning that you have, but “Ivy League” was the term a sports writer gave to the league of those eight colleges many years ago and it stuck. When I am assigned to officiate a soccer game at Harvard or Brown, it comes from the Ivy Athletic League Assignor. People need to understand the correct meaning of a term. It is a Ivy League (singular). As long as you use the term properly, you are fine. It is singular, and ONLY refers to those eight colleges of that Athletic league in the Northeast of the USA. Just like NESCAC has Amherst, Williams and other smaller liberal arts centered colleges in their athletic league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since you will graduate next June and were planning on taking the SAT in the Spring of 2020, which was cancelled, then: You have Already studied. Don’t sweat it, stop worrying. If the test is offered, then take it otherwise merely take a deep breath and smell the roses. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a case by case basis. You will arrive on campus, and then during freshman orientation you will schedule to meet with the head of the department or that person’s designate for each course you are trying to get credit for. Make certain to bring your official college transcript with you And the text book that you used. And do Not be surprised if the professor opens the book, thumbs through, asks you a couple of questions and then states: This course barely covers what MIT expects. Here, get this other book and study chapters 12 thru 15 on your own….. And then gives you credit. You have to Earn your credit at MIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over 50 million people died from the 1919 flu pandemic world-wide and the vast majority were in the Second wave. Expect the same from the COVID-19 until either vaccinations are wide-spread or enough people get it and many die to get herd immunity like what happened by 1920 for that other pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phone in your bedroom?????????????? Our sons were not allowed to have any electronics in their bedroom when it was Bed Time. All of our phones were/are placed in a central place in the house to be charged and backed-up to the cloud over night. And yours should be as well. However, prior to bed time and not during meals, then you should be able to carry your phone with you. No phones at the dinner table nor during breakfast. All the best.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Army? Personally, I would head to the USAF or Navy for some great engineering related billets. Indeed, I have seen the USAF put an enlisted person through college, then make him an officer, then send him to AFIT for a Masters degree and then send him to UC Berkeley to get a PhD in nuclear physics. Choose your military branch wisely. But if you want combat, then head to the Marines and if you want lots of exciting rescues then head to the Coast Guard. Good luck, and choose wisely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I believe that five courses per semester is more than enough for most people to carry. Maybe add in one not-too-difficult elective like computer programming, etc. I did that, five honors classes through high school, was admitted early action to MIT and never took more than five courses per semester at MIT. There is no reason to overload. None what so-ever. If you have to ask, then don’t do it. Work with your guidance counselor as that person should know you well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was the same for me in the Summer of 1972 and for our sons in the Summers of 2012 and 2013. In the summer between junior and senior year of college we all lived away from home and worked jobs that were associated with our future careers. Therefore, at that point we were “gone”. We had our drivers licenses, our passports, our bank accounts, and a place to live. We had all the clothes and other “things” that one needs for basics. Other stuff we bought. So, by age 20/21 we were Moved Out and on our own. We all lived away from home for college, but in the Summers prior to the freshman, sophomore and junior years of college we went home to work and therefore we didn’t really “fly from the nest” completely until that following summer. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“average guys”….. When I referee a NCAA D-1 women’s soccer game, I stand 5 foot 9 inches tall and weigh 165 pounds. Many times I am the shortest person on the field. NCAA D-1 and D-2 and many D-3 athletes are in Peak shape and therefore, will be more athletic than the “average” guy of the same age who is not an athlete. I remember meeting the Villanova University softball catcher who lived down the hall from my son. She was huge and was carrying three boxes (and I would have had a problem with any One of those boxes). Do NOT mess with NCAA D-1 female athletes. Period. (Of course, never mess with anyone, but guys should Not think they are more athletic and stronger as a non NCAA athlete than the average NCAA D-1 female athlete)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, an employer must: Follow the Federal Guidelines (scroll down): Tax Benefits for Education: Information Center . The employer must determine how much money they wish to invest in their staff and for what purpose. Therefore, most employers will need to set-up a two-step process The employee needs to show that the tuition assistance will ultimately benefit the company (employer) through the supervisor and the human resources staff, and that the the attendance of the school and the required homework won’t interfere with the employee’s work schedule or performance Most of the US companies that I am familiar with require the employee to get Prior approval, and then the employee is Not reimbursed until the company receives a copy of the official transcript. Then the employee gets maximum reimbursement for an A or B grade and only 50% reimbursement for a C and nothing for a D grade. There is always an issue. The Federal maximums of $5,500 per year (tax free) a re per Calendar Year. Therefore, if an employee takes a course in the Fall semester (September thru December) and then gets an A or a B and gets full reimbursement, the reimbursement may not be made until January of the following year, and therefore counts against the maximum for that following year…………………. And one can not double-dip and use the GI bill and employee reimbursement for the same expenses. Work with your company’s human resources group and if you own a small company then hire a 3rd party group to run your benefits for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The goalkeeper in association football (soccer) under all of the various sets of laws, is allowed to use their handling privileges “once per play”. If the goal keeper is holding the ball and then places the ball on the ground so it can be played with the feet, it is illegal for that goal keeper to use the handling privilege again until an opponent touches the ball, or a team mate legally touches the ball. Similarly, if the goal keeper “parries” the ball to the ground and the referee believes (in the opinion of the referee) that the ball easily could have been caught and held, and the goalie merely used the handling privilege to put the ball back into play, then as above, it would be illegal for the the keeper to use the handling privilege again until the ball is touched by an opponent or legally touched by a team mate. NOTE: I say legally touched by a team mate, because a team mate is Not allowed to kick the ball to a place that the goalkeeper can easily use handling privileges on the ball, if the keeper uses the handling privilege. It sounds complex, but it is rather straight forward, especially if you have been refereeing U16 or older soccer for any length of time. Enjoy the great game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First we know Nothing about you and your financial standing nor of which country you are a citizen. However, assuming you are a single, a student and an US citizen or permanent resident working in the USA, then: Do You Need To File A Tax Return In 2019? If your maximum income (every thing) is $12,000 or less, they you do Not need to file a Federal Income tax form and thus……………………….. Many teenagers and colleges students babysit to make some extra income. When our two sons were younger than 3 years old, we got baby sitters from some near-by colleges who were 20 or older. I doubt they made enough money to matter. On the other hand, if you are in an Avocation, like I am, which is being a high school, college and adult amateur soccer referee, where 80% of my income is by check or direct deposit and some agencies file a 1099 on me, and 20% is cash and I file a Schedule C for self-employment……………. You can bet your “bottom dollar” that I account for Every penny that is paid to me (even in cash) and I also look for every deduction allowed for a self-employed person. And when I go through a detailed security review every five years (for my aerospace engineering vocation), the investigator visits my assignors and asks if I am honest and if I declare all my income………… That is more recent……. So, if you make less than $12,000 per year, then you are fine. If you make more than $12,000 per year, then consider filing a Schedule C for your baby sitting self-employment, declare all the income and find all of the deductions. It is a great educational experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every freshman applicant for college should apply to at least one great-fit college Early. That could be Early Action like I did at MIT or Early Decision, which is a Binding Contract, at Columbia or Cornell: Columbia Undergraduate Admissions . As long as you have Everything in order and can Easily submit your complete application before the end of October, then Go For It. However, the overall admission rate for international freshman applicants is less than 3% to these elite private US colleges, and since these are Need Aware for international freshman applicants, the admission rate will be closer to one percent. Good luck, and have an excellent back-up plan. There are many fine colleges in India, and since you will be taking the time and effort to apply to an US college (early) then find a few other great fits in the US and apply there as well. Finally: Columbia and Cornell can not be More different if they tried. How can each be a great fit for You? Take a hard look at both and see what Ithaca looks like in January….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Blank check? For what? You establish a pay rate for yourself, and issue yourself a normal pay check. Anything left over, becomes profit and then you do your profit sharing at the end of the fiscal year. And, depending upon how your company is structured, you may have to put some personal money into the company to keep is solvent from time to time. However, you need to establish a pay-rate for yourself, so you should always (I believe) issue yourself a real pay check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the last ten years, about 17 small private colleges in New England either closed or merged with other (larger) colleges. It is the fate of many of the tiny private colleges and the pandemic is merely accelerating that process. However, public colleges should be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was on my high school’s student council and also in “student government” at college. In general the high school student council is a means for the students to negotiate for changes in the rules that have been set by the administration. I was fortunate to be on the council when our school was brand new. Therefore, we got together to “Over Rule” the school administration as to what our school’s nickname/mascot would be and school colors. We also got to appoint the committees to design the school ring, and come up with the names for the student newspaper and year book. Being that your school is only 4 years old, your student government may wish to revisit those things with the school administration. Additionally, you may have to negotiate to have more (or any) school dances or other social functions. The ability to have vending machines in the school and what those vending machines can sell will be something that the student council may need to weigh-in on. What sort of Punishment is mete out by the school administration to miscreant students? If the punishments are too severe or not severe enough, etc. should be something that the student council needs to work with the adminisration. The student council is the method for the students to elect representatives who are tasked to work well with the administration to make “things” work smoothly between the student body and the teachers and administrators and to negotiate for more privileges for the students as they transition from mere children into young adults. Don’t forget to get a Student Lounge for the juniors and the seniors. Also, depending upon the size of your town/city and how many public high schools are in your district, you may get to elect a student representative to the School Board which is a very powerful position if treated correctly. Good luck and focus on the task.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a freshman at MIT on the (then) freshman intercollegiate soccer team, I was subjected to the tradition of Phillips Exeter and Phillips Andover soccer teams Beating Up on our D-3 freshman teams. They had many PG players (13th year) and most of those were destined for NCAA D-1 teams. However, later I coached the MIT (then) JV team (mostly freshmen) and we beat Andover that year. Great to break a tradition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Send tourists where?????????????????? Currently, SpaceX has one person (I believe only one) who has put a down-payment on a Starship flight around the Moon and then return to Earth (no landing on the Moon). Also SpaceX has an agreement with NASA to shuttle tourists to the ISS when permitted, and SpaceX has one tourist lined-up and is searching for a couple of more tourists: SpaceX will send three tourists to the International Space Station next year So, do you have $55+ million in spare change??? Enjoy your Multi-Million dollar flights…<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the last 15 years, I have known four people (children of close friends) who went to medical school. All four took one to two years off after earning their bachelors degrees to Mount a Campaign to get into medical school. In college, they took all the courses that the medical schools listed as prerequisites. That was simple. However, they all attended high pressure colleges (MIT, Brandeis, Tufts, etc.) and wanted to Prove to the medical schools that they were worthy of being admitted. They each got medically related jobs to show the medical schools that they understood what the medical field was all about. They all studied hard for, and then took the MCAT tests and did very well on those exams. They then all had time-off from their jobs to criss-cross the USA to attend the many face-to-face interviews that are mandated by the top medical schools. And they all got admitted to medical schools that were of major interest to them. Simple. Prepare by spending one to two years after earning a bachelors degree in mounting a Campaign for medical school. NOTE: I also know four people who got accepted to a BS-MD program. Three were in the original Boston University 6-year bachelors and MD program and attended classes straight for those six years (no summers “off”), and one recently graduated from the eight year joint program at Brown. If you really want to do that, then apply to Brown, Boston University and I believe Northwestern for their joint programs. One admission for bachelors degree and medical school. But only the best of the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money. Pure and simple. There used to be 32 teams, and that expanded to 48 and then 64. Then with TV waving tons of money in the face of the NCAA, they came up with four play-in games. So eight of those 68 teams play in the First-Four games, and the four winners then round out the 64 in the main tournament. And the NCAA and those eight colleges make a lot of MONEY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a work-friend, who enlisted in the USAF, and had the USAF pay for his bachelors degree. Then he was sent to the AFIT (USAF Institute of Technology), where he earned a Masters degree. Then the USAF sent him to UC Berkeley to earn a PhD in Physics. Easy and simple. Be a decent high school student and speak at length with your local military recruiter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would easily be the local community college in your state. And of course, there are five Federal US colleges that are completely Free for all who attend: Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine Academies and that is over 4,000 freshman each year: Free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have 12 nieces and nephews who started graduating from college in 2003, and the last one is still in college. Of the 12, eleven went to college within a ten hour car drive of their home, and most within a 6 hour drive. One went 2000 miles away and Suffered in those round-trips each semester but thoroughly enjoyed her college and college life. And then stayed much closer to “home” for graduate school. Having to fly to get to your college within the 48 contiguous US states is a “bummer” and unless you are attending a Truly great fit for a college, it is Not worth it. I attended MIT and was lucky it was less than a 5 hour drive from my home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many will try in August. Many are starting the Fall 2020 term in August and plan on finishing that term before Thanksgiving, and then the Spring term will start February 1st after the Second HUGE wave of COVID-19 infections and deaths starts to subside. Many of those colleges are setting aside one to two complete dorms for the recuperation of students who come down with COVID-19 during the fall term. Enjoy your social interactions on campus……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normal? No. Accepted? Yes. Normal is you have a job or a graduate school program lined up prior to graduation. I had both. I graduated on Friday, and was working two half-time jobs at MIT on Monday and then started as a graduate student at MIT that following September. On the other hand our oldest son graduated as a mechanical engineer and 2/3rds of his ME graduates, a month prior to graduation, did not have a graduate school or a job lined-up. So many, like our son, came home to our house near Boston, and worked a part time job to save money while spending 20 hours per week looking for full-time engineering positions. It took him 6 months, but he finally got an excellent job offer 60 miles from where we lived, and he moved out quickly and into a shared apartment close to his job. That is the normal process.<|endoftext|>

Have your school administrators get their Act together and act like Local Parents and not some perverted form of buddies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way Rice states it: Standardized Testing and Freshman Application and Checklist They no longer Recommend it, and if you don’t take them they will not count against you. However, Rice will consider them during the admissions review process. Whereas a college like MIT, specifically states that they will Not even consider the SAT subject test scores in the future: A special announcement about SAT Subject Tests | MIT Admissions Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apps? It is called: Common sense with a touch a Frugality. Write down your monthly expenses on a piece of paper (one sheet per month). On that same sheet of paper write down your net monthly income (after taxes and deductions….. e.g. what is deposited in your bank account or cash that you receive from gig-work). On average, over 12 months, your expenses should be Less than your income. And you should be paying your credit card statements, each month, in Full. And, eventually, the net balance in your bank account should equal one-half of your total annual expenses, as a Minimum. Simple. I have used that technique for over 40 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colleges expect that. That is why all colleges have a wait list. And, the deposit (now, many times well over $1,000) is Non Refundable. Go ahead, make their day…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like our son did: “Mom and Dad, I am going to do my second term junior year in college at the University of Melbourne.” Simple. We were ecstatic as we had both traveled abroad as college-aged students. However, if you are referring to a High School student exchange, then as parents we would Not have been supportive of that. They did not know enough Spanish to survive in our local grocery store, let alone in Spain. And most of high school exchange is to take classes in a foreign language. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note, most colleges require full or a major partial payment for each semester before the semester starts. Typically at least half-payment. You would lose your entire payment to the college for that dorm room. Period. You would lose any payment you made for meal-tickets, unless you have a way to sell those to others. If you are withdrawing from the college, you will get most of your tuition payment (for that semester) back minus a processing cost. Enjoy the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Online? generally nothing. Contact your doctor to ask about any underlying health issues that you have, and assuming you are a normal 17 year old teenager, then check with your town-hall and local hospital for onsite in-person volunteering.

<|startoftext|>These are the types of questions best resolved by looking at data sites like http://collegeboard.org I compared Harvard to Princeton to Brown to sample three of the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League. Compare Colleges and Universities For Harvard 75% of the admitted freshmen scored a 33 or higher on the ACT and for Brown it is 75% scored a 32 or higher (Princeton didn’t list an ACT score). However, 25% scored lower, so a 30 should be OK as long as the rest of your application is Very strong (top 2 to 5% of your graduating class and excellent letters of recommendation that highlight you as a superb Person) Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. First driving a motor vehicle is Not a right, it is a privilege (USA). Second, there are normally two reasons they can stop you: The police officer notes that you did something wrong or apparently wrong. And when stopped you must always assume that the Driver (not any passengers) must show a drivers license. Period. End of discussion. Every car is being stopped at a road block. And when stopped you must always assume that the Driver (not any passengers) must show a drivers license. Period. End of discussion. However, if the police officer believes something else is “wrong” with one or more of the passengers, then the police officer may ask for the passenger’s name and ask to see an ID. However, in the USA, a passenger does not need to have any form of ID. Be polite. Keep your hands in plain sight. No sudden moves. Period. Good luck and enjoy the experience.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Responsibilities? That child is a member of a family. As a member of the family they should keep their room “neat”. Place their dirty clothes in the dirty clothes “basket” and put away their clean clothes. Always. If they are playing in another part of the house they need to Pick Up after they are finished. No excuses. The time required to pick-up must be considered as part of the playing time. No mad dashes out the door for soccer practice or gymnastics, etc. until they have cleaned up or specifically been given permission to clean-up later. At meal time they assist in setting their place or the overall table from time to time, and should be able to chop some vegetables for a salad or a dish to assist with the meal preparation. After each meal they rinse their own dishes/glasses and place them properly in the dish washer (or if no dish washer, then they assist in washing drying dishes with the Family). They assist in recycling. They assist in shoveling snow, raking leaves and helping to keep the outside of the house clean. (They are too young at 8 years old to be using a lawn mower). When the parents are fixing something in the house or painting something, etc. they should offer to assist and learn how to do the task properly. Their responsibilities are to become valued Members of the Family. Period. And, of course, they always get their home work assignments done on time and they always make Every practice and game for any sports/activity that they have joined. No exceptions (no missing anything for parties, etc.) If they are a team member then they are a Team Member. Also, they have the responsibility of selecting one major activity per season. No figure skating practice then a basketball practice. Or they get themselves to the secondary activities. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First what does social distancing have to do with appealing a parking ticket??? I successfully appealed three parking tickets that were erroneously “credited” to my car. I did that all by e-mail or phone or mail. Never saw anyone in person. It is Not worth the time and effort (ever) to appeal a parking ticket that you deserved to get. The highest parking ticket I ever got was for $50 and I merely paid it. I parked, and did Not see the “tiny” sign that stated resident stickers only…… However, it would have taken Hours and a 100 mile round-trip to appeal…… Not worth it. I got my $50 of parking that day and a good memory of it. Either call or write or pay the ticket.<|endoftext|>

The equipment that you wear can affect how you play, and therefore, in training for your team, you should wear your equipment. And especially for your cleats. Wear the cleats you normally wear for games. And how your sock and shin guards fit, may affect how your cleat fit.<|endoftext|>

About eleven years. And, you can calculate this yourself using an Excel spread sheet. At the beginning of each month the amount you owe will increase by 5.4/12 or 0.45%. And then each month you make a payment which will reduce the amount you owe. Each row is a month. Have a Lot of rows in your spreadsheet, and change the monthly amount you want to pay and you will see when the amount you owe goes to Zero. Simple. Excel workbook and a little understanding of how interest works when it is compounded. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh??? How much fuel is on-board that model rocket??? 10 or 30 seconds worth? 60 seconds? And how is this rocket chasing a storm? And why would an airline want to be involved with rockets chasing storms, let alone what the FAA would think about all of that?????? Try using an UAV that can fly to within some distance of the “storm” and the UAV would be carrying a “model rocket” (very carefully) and when at the correct altitude and distance from the storm, launch the rocket towards the storm to gather data. The data could be stored on a flashdrive and then recovered from the “destroyed” rocket. Have some signal attached to the flash drive so you can find it after the storm has destroyed the rocket. Work with local Model Aircraft and Amateur Rocket groups to build your devices properly and to Obey all local, state and Federal rules for the operation of the UAV and the rocket. Good luck and SAFETY first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prejudice in what manner? If you are not admitted to the college, then how are you going to sue? You would need to be in the USA on some other visa to establish credibility to sue in a state court. If you are on a F1 student visa and are dismissed/expelled from the college, then you will need to leave the USA within 30 days (possibly 60 days) and it is unlikely you can get a lawsuit to court in that short time. So what is it you are trying to sue about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To me the obvious ones are: tennis, golf, track & field, cross country, beach volleyball (2v2), nordic and alpine skiing, bicycle racing, table tennis, bowling (every other lane) Most team sports are difficult to play during the pandemic and basketball is probably the worst. On the other hand there are versions of slow-pitch softball that would be fine to play during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA there are Federal standards Federal Gasoline Regulations | US EPA and state monitoring of the businesses. And the car companies would complain if the gasoline being sold caused any problems in their cars. If you buy gasoline at a “reputable” gasoline station (and most are), there should be no problems. Part of the issue will be the gasoline station keeping their storage tanks clean, with no water in the tanks and to keep their storage tanks mainly filled, so what little sediment there is in the tank, remains at the bottom of the storage tank and not in your car’s gasoline tank….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I believe the basic standards should be set by a state-appointed educational council. Then each school district (each school board) will hire educational experts to assist in crafting the course content for each subject area and grade level. Indeed, that is the way it is done in Massachusetts, where we live, and MA has the best public school system in the USA and also set the standards for the measurement of educational quality through the grade levels. I am proud of the MA system and believe our sons did quite well under that system. And for many years I have interviewed freshman applicants to MIT and those in MA do quite well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. There are field space considerations. If there are no high school sports in the Fall of 2020, then one will need to wait until the Fall of 2021. And, it is Winter 2020–21 and Spring 2021 sports that most likely will be cancelled. I believe a lot of high schools will attempt to have Fall 2020 sports. Then the 2nd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will hit like a freight train around Thanksgiving and deaths will shoot up rapidly and we will be into a six-month lock-down until at least 85% of the US population has herd immunity through vaccinations or recovery from the virus. Enjoy the Summer…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I attended MIT as an undergraduate from 1969–1970. Our sons attended college from 2009–13 and 2010–14. I tried to stay within a five hour drive of my home area (upstate NY) and therefore did Not even consider attending any of the fine colleges in California, let alone those South of Washington DC. Of course there are many excellent colleges within a five hour drive of central NY State. We live in Boston area, and our sons attended colleges outside of Philadelphia (about 40 miles apart from each other) and less than a 6 hour drive from our home. I recommend: Attending a college at Least an hour drive from your home area, and less than an 8 hour drive. If possible. Try to spread your wings and attempt to fly while maturing from a raw teenager into an adult during those four years as an undergraduate student in college. And live on campus at least for the first two years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lenient?????? 70% of the high school academic year was OVER when schools closed and switched to online education for the remaining 30%. And from my recollection, the last 25% of the high school academic year is: reviewing material for the final exam, completing major projects (which you do at home anyway), and taking the final exam. The colleges that admitted you should expect you to do Very Well in that last 30% of the academic year. Otherwise how will you survive at a college this coming Fall in the midst of the pandemic? If you can’t handle time management then are you really prepared for college?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will need to show the US consulate staff member who interviews you for your F-1 student visa a current Passport. If your passport is from Pakistan, then you are applying as a Pakistani. If you also have a Canadian passport, then you can apply as a Canadian………. Of course, if you are at an US consulate office in Pakistan for the interview, that will be interesting to explain the Canadian passport, but think it through. There are three issues: Are you from a country from which the US government is trying to reduce the number of people who enter the USA? Do you have sufficient funds to cover the cost of what the I-20 form states you need to pay to attend college, per year, in the USA? Can you convince the consulate staff member that you will Gladly and 100% likely leave the USA once your F-1 visa is about to expire. In that order of importance. Your nationality (passport) does not influence how the staff member looks at your answers to the second and third criteria. However, your passport will have a HUGE effect on the first criteria and may terminate the visa application immediately if the US government no longer supports visitors or students from that country…… Have a Long discussion with your parents for guidance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is June of 2020. A rising freshman at Northeastern, is one who will be a freshman at Northeastern in the late Summer and Fall of 2020. In general, those people were in the “class of 2020” from high school, unless they did a PG year at a private boarding school so they could get an athletic scholarship to play ice hockey or soccer or basketball, etc., for the Huskies. So, for a Typical college, you would add four years to the year that they start at the college (2020) and arrive at the Class of 2024…… BUT, Northeastern is Not typical. Northeastern pivots around a Co-Op model in which you spread four years of course work (and tuition payments) over Five years, and interspersed are three six-month long paying Co-Op jobs that are related to your major. Therefore, someone who is a freshman at Northeastern in the Fall of 2020 is expected to graduate after Five years at Northeastern, and therefore would be part of Northeastern’s Class of 2025. Neat!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I am dressed like an ice hockey goaltender, playing ice hockey, and all the players on the opposing team are harassing me. Sometimes I dress like a soccer referee, and go out and referee men’s open soccer games by myself and have more than 22 people “harassing” me. Just ignore them and do what you love to do, in the way you love to dress…… However, I am Not making some ‘subtle” statement by dressing as a goaltender or as a soccer referee. I am merely wearing what is Appropriate for what I am doing, and they don’t harass me for what I wear, but for what I am doing. So why are You dressing as you do, and what Statement are you making intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if a boy showed up at high school dressed in a Tuxedo, he would probably be “harassed”. If a boy or girl showed up at high school dressed in beachwear, they would probably be harassed. Dress for yourself, but dress appropriately for the occasion and you mostly likely will not be harassed. But, if you are wearing certain types of clothing for a good reason, then take a moment to Educate those others. For if you can educate at least 25%, they will understand and then assist you in educating the others. Take it as a challenge, if it is worth it. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. You could even take courses at a community college while attending another university (just an extreme example). However, what will hurt you in owing money to that university is that until you pay that university all of the money that you owe them, you will Never get an official transcript from the university regarding the courses you took there and therefore you can Never use that course work towards the units you need to get a degree. Work out a payment plan with the university.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Depends (for the USA): If you are living at home and have Not finished (graduated) from high school, then what your boy friend likes/dislikes is irrelevant, you are still a Minor child and must abide by the restrictions established by your parents. However, once you are over 18, have completed high school (or dropped out), then you move out from your parents home, live on your own, and merely deal with your friends, yourself and any restrictions placed upon you by your employer. If you are in-between: completed high school, over 18 and are still living with your parents………. That is a bit more touchy and you should try to compromise a bit, as your parents are still giving you a place to live. Typically, if it is the summer After freshman year of college, Or you have worked for a full year at a full-time job and are contributing to the expenses of your parents house, then you merely deal with your friends, yourself and any restrictions placed upon you by your employer.

I (we) did the same for our sons. Their closet and clothes drawers were Open to all, and the room was Expected to be neat, and any “mess” was subject to inspection. However, we did not go through their desk drawers, but we were cognizant of what they were doing in the house. Had we had any suspicions., then I would have dismantled everything in that room to check it out. Our sons knew that and kept “their noses clean”, so to speak.

<|startoftext|>When you are holding a F1 student visa in the USA, you may work Any job on-campus and off-campus you may work any job that is generally related to your major. And any off-campus job will count against your OPT. You need to check with your college’s DSO. As you will need to coordinate with the DSO for any off-campus job. For example: When I was an undergraduate at MIT, majoring in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, I was basically majoring in engineering. Summer after freshman year at MIT, I worked as a junior engineer for my state’s DOT as a member of a survey crew. That is applying the basic principles of mathematics and physics that are required to be an Engineer. The next summer, I worked for an Aluminum company, making, fixing and installing aluminum doors, screens and awnings. That is hands-on mechanical work that is required to fully understand Engineering. Therefore, while I am an US citizen and not bound by the F-1 visa restrictions, you could get a summer job that is “remotely” related to your major. And if you are majoring in hotel management and hospitality, you could work in the summer at any restaurant or fast-food service, for example. Speak with your DSO. You do NOT need an internship. You merely need a paying job that is remotely related to your major and your DSO will assist in making that connection (between major and job). Good luck and enjoy the Work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Constitutional rights. Those are the rights that people in the USA have regarding the authority of the Federal Government and based upon your state’s constitution, the rights you have regarding the authority of the state government. Those “rights” do not apply to private entities. And children (minors under the age of 18) are under the authority of their parents or if in school the “local parent” or the authority of the school. So a city or state or federal police officer can not walk into your school and demand to search your backpack or pockets or locker. However, your parents can and therefore the school (local parent) can. So you have constitutional rights, but not from your parents or local parents as a minor.<|endoftext|>

As for her safety, the current death rate for the 5 to 25 year old age bracket from COVID-19 is 1 out of 10,000 which is the same as it was for measles prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, and plenty of people under the age of 25 dated before 1963.

<|startoftext|>In general, for the USA, she would need to pay-off the car, get the Title to the car in her name, then sell the car to you for One Dollar, and sign the title over to you. Then you would take the Title and having your own insurance policy, register the car in your name and get your own plates. However, if she can’t pay it off, and you don’t have enough money to pay it off, she can let you drive it, while it remains on her auto insurance policy, and then she has to report where you garage/park the car at night and at work/school to her insurance company. Then she still owns the car, and you merely use the car. There may be an alternative to all of that, but those are the two easiest ways. Of course, you could get a car loan and buy the car from her for what she owes, but the timing and process of that is not truly known to me. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Based merely on your academic studies and degrees Only, the chances of getting permanent US residency (green card): Bachelors degree: negligible to zero. Masters degree in a required niche area: slight to small PhD in a required niche area: Medium to large That is because some company or university needs to want to hire you for your abilities and spend a lot of time and money to convince the US government to grant you permanent residency. However, if you get a masters degree in engineering in the USA, you will have roughly 29 months of OPT working in the engineering industry. If you prove your worth to a company, then they may spend the time and money to assist you in getting a green card.

<|startoftext|>Extracurricular means “external to the curriculum”. Therefore, you are saying that you do Nothing, other than attend school, take classes and then study for those classes. Nothing else. You have no interests that put you in face-to-face contact with others and allow you to demonstrate various aspects of: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character. Extracurricular activities are Not confined to activities outside of the curriculum in your school. They include all sorts of things that people do in their extended community: Part-time job during the academic year or full-time during school breaks Assisting with a sick or disabled family member or friend or neighbor Church activities with others Any type of volunteering in your community. etc. Sad, truly sad. There is much to life than merely studying academic subjects. Much more. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>US colleges of the caliber of U Texas at Austin only admit students who the college Believes can attend, do well in a major and graduate in a timely fashion. If U Texas believes in you, then you have to really try to believe in yourself. If you “resonate” with the major that you select, you will do just fine. And find a nice peer group to study with, and use common sense and good time management while in college (and always). Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, you have a chance for admission. US Citizens have roughly an 8 to 9 percent chance of being admitted to those colleges (given that 10% of the admitted students are international with a 2.5% chance of admission). And at least 2/3rds of the applicants have more than sufficient academic prowess to attend the college, survive freshman year, do well in a major and graduate in a timely manner: Required but Insufficient. Therefore, you have roughly a One out of Eight chance of being admitted to one of the colleges. How will you “beat out” seven of those applicants to be the one? Find colleges that are a great fit for you and convince the college that you are a great fit for the college. Therefore, focus on what You want out of the complete four years in college, in class and on campus and in that region of the country and with that undergraduate student community Get EXCELLENT letters of recommendation from: Mandatory from guidance counselor (or headmaster) who will discuss you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person Two teachers as indicated by the college and selected by you who should be more than willing to write a glowing hot letter of recommendation on your behalf 2 to 3 supplemental letters of recommendation written by independent (from you) adults who would be respected by the college and who know what a Person you are outside of the classroom If the college does not accept supplemental letters of recommendation, then have that person send it to your guidance counselor for inclusion in that mandatory letter of recommendation (in some fashion) And all of those colleges got together and published a report on what they expect from a successful freshman applicant. Read this article, the links and especially the full report: Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An astronautical engineer is one who assists in the design of systems and components that are used outside of the Earth’s atmosphere. The aerospace industry has the highest ratio of engineers to total employees of any industry. And many of those are mechanical engineers or materials engineers, or chemical engineers, or electrical engineers, etc. Any engineer who works for a rocket or satellite company, in general, is an “astronautical engineer” and certainly an aerospace engineer. I was formally trained as an Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineer, however, many of the people I work with in the aerospace industries were not. They are very good engineers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can be hired in the aerospace field if you have US permanent residency. However, many aerospace companies do a huge amount of military work, and would expect you to be able to get a basic DOD security clearance. You can get a basic DOD security clearance, IF the DOD investigators can contact all police agencies in the regions in which you have lived for a minimum of seven years prior to the application. Therefore, if you are from a country that will not cooperate with the US DOD security investigators, then you won’t get a clearance and many times will either be shuttled to a low-level job or terminated from your job. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MIT and all of the US colleges assume that a person’s high school ends between April and June and that they will start college in late August or early September later that year. To apply one submits an application by the end of October (early action/decision) or by the end of December of the previous year. Therefore, if you want to start college in the late August or early September of 2021, you would apply soon, and the application process “opens up” in mid-August 2020. You will go onsite to MIT Admissions and read Everything there, including the blogs that are written by the professional admissions staff, many of whom were MIT students earlier in their lives. You will register at the MyMIT site (from the above web site) in August.

<|startoftext|>One of our sons spent January - June of his junior year at college (2013), at the University of Melbourne. February starts their school year in Australia and he arrived in early January. He had pre-arranged for an apartment near campus and rented it from January through June. When he arrived in Melbourne, he moved into his apartment (I believe to live in the building you had to be a student at U Melbourne, but it was not owned by the university). The next day he got a cell phone to use in Australia and opened up a bank account. Both were within sight of his apartment building. Then he traveled for three weeks. Then he started courses.

<|startoftext|>Several of my high school classmates joined our school at the start of junior year. It was fine. We all got along and became good friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most US colleges for engineering undergraduates are very intense and have a very tight schedule for all of the mandated courses that must be taken to earn a bachelors degree. Therefore, very few have any study abroad programs for engineers. Indeed, at U Delaware the study abroad was only for the one-month Winter term of January. However, at MIT, I managed to put-together an eight month (January - August of junior year) Co-OP paying job in England by overloading in courses in earlier terms and taking one course during the summer after freshman year. I would not expect to attend an engineering program at an US college and get more than a one-quarter overseas experience (see WPI).

<|startoftext|>Expect little to no financial aid at a Public university like U Texas at Austin The University of Texas at Austin UTexas and most Public universities in the USA look at international undergraduate students as Cash Cows, and expect you to pay in full and in cash.

The COVID-19 death rate for the 5 to 18 year old age-group is 1 out of 10,000 which is the same as it was for that age group from measles, before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963. And very few children were home schooled prior to 1963, and people just accepted children getting measles and then recovering at home for two weeks (been there, done that). Indeed the suicide rate for the 17 to 25 year old college-age group is 1.2 out of 10,000 or higher than that from COVID-19, and yet no one was preventing their children from attending college. The issue is Not the 5 to 25 year old people. It is the 35 and older people who associate with the younger people…..<|endoftext|>

Indeed, MIT employees get free bus and subway usage through their MIT ID cards to discourage the use of cars. Just an example.

<|startoftext|>Yes. Studies have shown that in still air, a violent Sneeze can propel the liquid droplets carrying the COVID-19 virus up to 23 feet. And other studies show that moderate wind can carry the droplets 10 to 30 feet from someone who is merely speaking in a normal voice: 6 Feet May Not Be Enough: Wind May Carry Coronavirus Farther Microclimate and turbulent wind can influence COVID-19 spread over long distances Which is why, as soon as masks were not scarce, it was recommended for everyone to wear one if they can not “socially distance” in general. Then the virus is caught in the mask if you have the virus and if you are healthy and people are all around you at various distances then you wear a mask to protect yourself. On the other hand, if you are regularly coughing or sneezing due to allergies or for any reason, you should wear a mask, Period. If you are “healthy” and merely outside walking or jogging or biking and will rarely be within 6 to 20 feet of others, then you don’t need to wear your mask, but carry a cloth covering/mask with you in case you wish to stop and talk. If you are talking to someone for more than 20 or 30 seconds and will be within 10 feet of the other person, then both of you should wear masks. Actually, it is all simple common sense, now that masks are more available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to think of an airliner having four primary systems for design Power plant (jet engines) Structure and load bearing components (landing gear, windshields, etc.) Electronics/Avionics/Controls Systems (HVAC, electrical, cooling, hydraulic, etc) And then take a Boeing 787 or an Airbus A350 which are both all composite structure aircraft, and the 787 (I know) went to an “all electrical” design eliminating the hydraulic system. In general each of those four has major complexities. They all have to be weight-efficient, therefore the materials and the structures are exceedingly complex. The engines and APU system are very complex. The electronics and avionics and control system are very complex, and the sub-systems which also must be weight-efficient are very complex. That it why it takes a team of engineers of many disciplines to work well together to design and manufacture a profitable airliner that is great for the airlines and for the aircraft manufacturer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, actually that is wise. Also, if you put down 20% or more, then you do Not have to pay the monthly fee for mortgage insurance. Speak with a mortgage broker and “run the numbers” for your situation with them. However don’t dip too far into your cash reserves for an emergency. If you have a 6 month cash reserves, then you can take it down to 3 months and build it back up over the next two years. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That depends…… I assume you have 30 year mortgage at some interest rate. If the interest rates drop then you can “run the numbers” to determine if it makes more sense to refinance (paying the refinance costs), lower the interest rate and get a 20 year pay-off term. However, if the interest rate change is not much from you currently have, then you can make additional payments each year and that will reduce the term for pay-off and the total amount of interest that you pay. Some people will make 13 payments each year every four weeks, instead of their current 12 monthly payments and that 13th is straight off the principle. Speak with a mortgage company and run the numbers for your situation with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually not that much if the aircraft is designed that way to begin with. For example take a look at the F-35: Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II - Wikipedia A for Air Force, B for STOLV operations for the Marines and C for the Navy and CATOBAR operations. You will note that the F-35A and the F-35C have the same maximum weight and same maximum range, however the Navy version has a 45% larger wing for the slower catapult launches and the F-35C can’t carry the same payload as the F-35A to its maximum range because of that plus the CATOBAR operations. However, most of that is in the larger wing. I would believe, as a aero-astro structures engineer, that starting at the beginning with naval version, and being selective about materials and load paths at the rear of the aircraft, the cable restraint landing and the well-designed landing gear and supporting structure didn’t add too much weight but probably a Lot of money for materials and design.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From the topics you reference, you note Russia twice. It may be that your parents are worried that you may be kidnapped and held for ransom if the word gets out: how wealthy they are, what they do for that wealth and where you will be when you are in school and not guarded at your house……. In those cases, never tell anyone how wealthy your family is. If a close friend asks what your parents do, then have a canned simple answer (for example): My mom sells houses and my dad does some financial stuff….. hey do you want to play a game or see a movie, etc.? Simple it answers their question and you move on. About school….. Some of your friends attend your school so that is moot. Whereas never volunteer where you attend school to strangers.

<|startoftext|>If you have a Drivers license and are practicing skidding in the snow and ice, and the parking lot is open with no posted restrictions in the USA, then you are OK until a police officer comes along, and tells you to stop doing that and leave the parking lot. I used to do that all the time at a large empty public school parking lot near my home during the Winter. And many times I was at one end of the parking lot practicing skids and recoveries and a police car was at the other end of the same parking lot doing the same thing. Try to look under control and not reckless. Yes, if you have a Learner’s Permit and have a legally licensed adult in the passenger seat who is supervising you, until a police officer comes along, and tells you to stop doing that and leave the parking lot. Try to look under control and not reckless. I used large empty public parking lots to train our sons (who had learner’s permits) to drive. No, if you do Not have a license or a permit. Because if you damage the car, the insurance company will Not pay and may drop the insurance on that vehicle for an unlicensed driver using the car…… Be careful, be Very careful, as what you think is a minor accident (damaging something in the parking lot) can turn into a MAJOR deal. Have the proper permit or license first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you accept a college’s offer of admission, pay the nonrefundable deposit (which can be well over $1,000) and take a gap year, there is nothing stopping you from applying to other colleges during the gap year and if accepted withdraw from the first college and accept the offer from the second college. Is it ethical? Not really if that is what you Planned to do. Whereas, if you sincerely go off on your gap year “research or job or educational travel”, etc. and during that determine that another college is a much better fit for you, then you send a polite letter to the first college withdrawing your admission and attend the second college. That is ethical and it is a part of “things change over time”. However, you still have to apply to those other colleges before the end of the current year, and that is not much of a gap, and you will have to “bug” your high school guidance counselor and several teachers for letters of recommendation and they may not care to provide a whole lot of assistance to someone who is no longer a student at that high school, when they have many current seniors applying to many colleges. Think it through and plan an Excellent gap year, which may provide you no real time to apply to other colleges…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You would probably have to be admitted to the astronaut corps in the next 25 to 30 years. It is most likely that you would need to emigrate from Lebanon to the USA and become a citizen in that time frame while getting a PhD degree in an area that will be necessary to be in space or to travel to another planet or the moon. Becoming a flight surgeon is one great example, as astronauts on long missions away from Earth will require medical assistance. There is always the chance that you could get a PhD in a required discipline and then over the next 30 years become a private civilian astronaut working for a company that buys your passage from one of the commercial launchers to a private or leased space station. However, I believe it is highly unlikely if you remain a citizen of Lebanon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example, someone gets a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, and then a Masters and PhD from the Aero-Astro Engineering department. That person certainly can return to MIT and get a MBA from the Sloan School, or go down the river and get a MBA from the Harvard Business School. Or go down the river and get a Law Degree from Harvard. Or, if they have another research interest, get funding and receive a PhD in mathematics or computer science after a few more years of research work and possibly course work. I have a friend who double majored in Physics and Electrical Engineering for bachelors degrees from MIT and then went on to get a MBA from Harvard and a Law degree from Yale (over-lapping in time). It can be done. It is not clear to me why someone would want two PhD degrees, as with the first PhD one should be able to get paid for research in a related area. And anyone can take selected course work. I have seen MIT professors auditing courses in other departments to pick up some extra knowledge that will assist them in their research. Do what you need to do to perform well in your career, but try not to have to Pay for all of that…..<|endoftext|>

I had a few “canned” opening questions just to get the conversation rolling, but then the rest of the discussion was a free-flowing conversation where the applicant asks questions and I ask questions based on the direction of the overall discussion. A college interview is Not to determine your academic prowess. It is to determine the type of Person you are outside of the classroom and whether you would be a good fit with the college and the college’s undergraduate community. Enjoy the interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are a very good student, and your one activity is to be a regional all-star in ice hockey (for example), and one of the ice hockey coaches in The Ivy Athletic League is recruiting you, then your chances of admission are greater than 80%. Otherwise, unless you are the legacy of some wealthy and powerful parents, your chances are slim. And if you are that international applicant then your chances are now less than 2% to 3%. However, if you can get some Glowing Hot letters of recommendation from your guidance counselor or head master (mandatory), two teachers of your selection, and your adult debate coach, then you stand a chance. But debate should be at least an 8 month activity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Customs agents in the USA enforce Federal laws. Drinking-age laws are the jurisdiction of each state. It is up to the state to enforce its own laws. However, in Boston for example, there is nothing to prevent a US customs agent from signaling to a Massachusetts State Police Officer, that the State Police officer may want to question this young person….. When I was 20 I crossed the border from Mexico to the USA many times with alcohol and the state that I was entering (California) had a 21 year old requirement to possess alcohol. Never had an issue. Look and act with some level of dignity and politeness and remain within the Federal limits of alcohol allowed into the US and most likely you will be fine. Look 17 and act silly, and you may wonder why that State Police Officer is following you……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the USA: It is the United States of America, and each of the fifty different states have different rules/regulations during the pandemic. The airlines transport paying passengers. It is up to the passengers to follow the local laws/regulations of the states and cities that they are flying to. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the current world-wide pandemic when most if not all schools in the USA are closed and the students are studying online at home? No. In regular times, when the students are supposed to be in school, and the school releases them to attend a protest? Yes. In regular times, when the students are supposed to be in school, and the students ignore commands to remain in the building and leave the building to protest? No. Indeed, they could be arrested for not being in school. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My answer is based on my experience in the USA with public schools. I graduated high school in 1969 and our sons graduated high school in 2009 and 2010. Every resident of a public school district should be aware of what the school system is doing, pay attention to the local government’s financial advisory panel’s reports and be an intelligent voter electing the members of the School Committee who run the schools. Be cognizant when the school committee hires a new Superintendent, and when the Superintendent hires various leads and principals. Hold the school committee accountable. Every parent should try to attend school functions for parents and all open-houses and opportunities to meet with your child’s teacher if invited to a parent-teacher conference. Indeed, you may ask for a parent-teacher discussion, if you have concerns about your child’s progress in school. Over the last 20+ years, in our state, anyone who has access to minor children, will be required to get a thorough state-level back-ground check. My wife had many as a parent volunteer when our sons were in school and I have one every three years as a high school soccer referee. One volunteers to Help the school by helping the teachers and staff. One does Not or should Not volunteer to influence the teachers or staff about your children. Period. As a father who knew how to control mobs of angry people (soccer referee), I volunteered many times to control the traffic flow at the school for large events. As an engineer, I volunteered several times to speak to middle and high school students about career choices and answer questions. However, I NEVER interfered nor tried to influence the course content of any of the public schools’ classes/courses. If I had a concern, it had to be major and across the “board”, and I addressed the school committee (with the superintendent present) with my concern, or sometimes a quiet word with the school principal. Never, directly with a teacher. And none of my concerns ever involved specific teachers. Later, after our sons had graduated, the new superintendent asked me to the on the SAC (superintendent’s advisory committee) for STEAM in the school system (That is STEM with Art see Press Releases | For Press | News | RISD .) I supported that for the two years the SAC was in existence. That is it. That is the extent of a resident’s or parent’s involvement. Get involved when Asked, and ask for a private conversation with a teacher if there are issues with your children. However, being a youth and adult soccer referee, I knew what norms were, and we rarely if ever asked for a private conference, and would make ourselves available if asked by a teacher or the school had an open house. Volunteer for the School and not for your Child. Over the years I have seen way too much money and time Wasted by school systems because some parents were too involved and primarily only for their children. It takes a Village and be a good member of that village.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is a list from May 2020 that you should read and understand: 3 Countries You Can't Visit With an American Passport (There is a longer list at the end of the article). If you have to visit one of those 15 countries prior to visiting the USA, then merely have an Excellent reason why you needed to visit that country when asked by the Customs and Border Patrol agent when you are trying to enter the USA. It does Not matter if you have a valid visa. If the CBP agent doesn’t feel comfortable with your entering the USA, you will be turned away, at your own expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly. The college student’s professor in Country A is professionally known to a professor at a college in the USA. They communicate and the student is allowed to assist in some remote research with the professor in the USA. Common. Professor to professor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A “normal” eleven year old (girl or boy): For how long is the child to be left alone? Many students who are that age can come home from school at 3:30 pm let themselves into the house, study and then help with dinner when a parent gets home from work at 5:30 pm. But no child that age should be left home alone all day (8 am to 5 pm) and No child that age should ever be left alone over night. It depends on the length of time, the time of day, what is your neighborhood like, and how trustworthy is your child. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three classes? She probably needs to be in a special education program or at least get an IEP soon. I doubt she can take 3 year-long classes in an 8 week summer session. Probably better to let her repeat 6th grade and get an IEP. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA no one is going to check on your age or status unless your parents have filed a “runaway child” issue with the local police who have broadcast your image and description across the USA. You probably don’t have a drivers license or formal ID, so you won’t be able to fly. You may be able to buy an Amtrak or Bus ticket with cash, as you won’t have a credit card under the age of 18. You could hitch-hike, but then you stand a good chance of being picked-up by the police along the way. So, if you know someone who is driving to another city and is willing to have you as a passenger, then go for it. But be wary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must find out Why? Why does your current thesis adviser not want to write a letter of recommendation to support your PhD application? Once you know Why, you can find the correct path forward. And if your adviser does not believe you currently have what it takes to be a PhD student in that field, then fine, get a job and work hard and well for a few years and then try four or five years from now. Many of my associates worked for several years after a Masters degree before pursuing a PhD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is a web site from a US college that specifically addresses your question: https://ois.usc.edu/students/f2dependents/current-f2-dependents/ Since your wife must be the F-1 visa holder (if you have a F-2 visa) then your wife should be consulting with her college’s DSO to get info and assist you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, if you can convince the customs and border patrol agent who will interview you as you attempt to enter the USA. You need to convince the agent that you have a very legitimate reason for being in the USA and convince the agent that it is obvious that you will leave the USA prior to the visa expiring. Many people go through that, as they return to their home country and need to set up a job and/or living arrangements and then return to the USA to move all of their belongings out of the USA and back to their new place of residence outside of the USA and close-up other loose ends in the USA. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, tired of people merely copying a home work problem verbatim and pasting it in as a Quora question. However, I do enjoy the obvious modification and the search for more insight into a homework problem, if the person takes the time to craft the question after obviously learning something from their homework assignment. Unfortunately those who seek a short-cut to a solution won’t spend the time to read your question nor our answers. Enjoy Quora.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any elite Private US college is much more than a mere “school”. You join an undergraduate community as a freshman and journey along with each of those members of that community from being a raw teenager into being an Adult. And you help each other. Many of your life-long friends will come from your undergraduate college experience. I did MIT for undergrad and graduate studies and I am “MIT through and through”. Someone like Richard Feynman did his undergraduate physics at MIT then graduate physics at Princeton and then became a professor and leader at Caltech. He would carry a little of each along with him, but MIT would be the foundation for that. Choose carefully as only Half of an undergraduate’s experience is studies. The other Half is Life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parking at USC? From my recollection, from the time you park your car until it is stolen is about a few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take your most modern 747–8i Boeing 747-8 - Wikipedia Around the Earth is slightly less than 21,700 nautical miles at the Equator. If you modified the 747, taking out all of the passenger seats and adding fuel bladders in the cargo bay, and with a flight crew of six pilots (taking shifts) you might be able to fly non-stop around the world in about 45 hours allowing time for take-off and climb out and landing. You would need to pre-approval for your flight route as you may over-fly some “nasty” or restricted areas. Add another 3 hours if you need to stop once to refuel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be a professional soccer player at a lower division level, you would need to be one of the best soccer players at a top amateur level. And, yes, at age 27 you could become one of the best players in your top local amateur league and then get a shot at playing Professionally at a low division level. But by Pro, you would be making money, but not enough to live on, so keep your day job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I referee a lot of NCAA college soccer and watch a lot of pro soccer. The basic game (two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute half time plus injury or wasted time) fits easily into a two hour time slot. Perfect for TV. At a high level with a lot happening in the game, that would be 45 + 45 + 15 + 10 = 115 minutes which is 5 minutes under 2 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politely tell the person, what you truly felt about their capabilities and that you don’t feel comfortable writing them a letter of recommendation to “That” job or college. Be truthful, sincere and helpful and they will gain much more than a letter of recommendation from you. They will gain insight to assist them in finding people who will write good letters for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>San Diego, by area, is one of the largest cities in the USA. Also, I found it relatively tame to drive around. Therefore, if you are going to explore the vast part of San Diego, then sharing a rental car is not that bad. However, if you are only partaking of the downtown area with a couple of side trips to Balboa Park and maybe Coronado, and Tijuana, then merely take Uber/Lyft or the Trolley which has a terminus at Tijuana Enjoy San Diego it is quite nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. College sports are for Amateurs. However, the Olympics already set a precedent many years ago when only amateurs were allowed. The Olympics allowed a special escrow account to be set-up into which prize winnings were deposited and the amateur athlete could draw out a modest amount for living expenses. Then when the athlete was done with the Olympics, they could go pro and have access to all of the money in the escrow account. The NCAA is putting together a plan for “something like that” for NCAA D-1 student-athletes. It will be voted on in February of 2021 and installed in the Fall of 2021. Most likely there will be a similar set-up of a special escrow account into which money from endorsements and the the use of the athlete’s picture will be deposited. In addition specially licensed agents will be allowed to assist the student-athletes. Then while the athlete is still maintaining eligibility to play NCAA sports, the athlete can withdraw a modest amount of money from the escrow account for certain expenses. Then, once the athlete is done playing NCAA sports, the athlete gets full access to the money. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check with your college. Every F-1 visa allows the student a minimum of 12 months of OPT and in STEM fields, upwards of 29 months (or more) of OPT. At MIT, with international students who completed their degree but were stuck in the USA due to the pandemic., MIT made them researchers on campus, provided them with rooms (if they were living on campus previously), so they can stay in the USA, have a place to live, are making money and working in their field. Hopefully you attended a college that cares about their students and if you did, check with your department head, your faculty adviser and then the three of you will work with your DSO. Easy. win-win-win-win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably.. That is why the Khan Academy exists and they do a good job. But remember that the SAT/ACT test is but a mere small portion of the overall application process and rarely tests much beyond the 10th grade course work. Manage your overall time well and you will do fine on those basic standardized tests and don’t forget the rest of your enjoyable high school experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does cracking your skull open have to do with a college admissions? Did the application ask anything related to recovering from a severe physical injury? The “essay” prompts are really Questions that the admissions staff want to ask while seated across the table from you and let you answer in your own verbal words. They can’t do that, so they ask for a written response. Read the Prompt carefully and address that prompt with a good answer that includes You as a person. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe I was about 6 years old, and when our family went I vacation, my father handed me a stack of paper maps and I was the navigator. By 13 years old I was winning awards in Orienteering in Boy Scouts, reading topo maps and using only a hand held compass and following a harrowing path through the woods and fields and across streams to reach a final destination. A little reading ability and a fundamental feeling for numbers and you will be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two reasons: Space is money and they make money for the college by selling that parking space Local regions are trying to decrease their carbon foot-print and therefore discourage the use of cars on campuses. Therefore, MIT raised their parking sticker fee from $5 per year to over $1,000 per year. Definite discouragement. Welcome to Capitalism 1.01<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All real athletes, especially in college and professionally, have to train. However, to become a NCAA D-1 athlete and especially to go Pro, one needs a certain amount of innate athletic ability. For that you can train all you want, but the vast majority of people will never succeed. Merely train to play sports at a generally challenging level for You, as long as you still enjoy playing the sport and the camaraderie of the team (if a team sport).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First the International Space Station’s life will continue to be extended by various members of the international consortium as long as it is cost effective.. Then, for NASA there will be : NASA: Artemis and specifically: the Lunar Gateway: More About Gateway Then on to Mars with an orbiting station for humans and humans on the planet’s surface. Eventually we will have “Belters” working in the Asteroid belt. However, if you are restricting your vision to LEO (low Earth orbit), everyone is hoping that private stations will evolve to be industrial work areas, scientific research and hotels and vacation spots. NASA scientist can then sub-let at that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that they can contract with a testing company to make their own standardized test for all freshman applicants to the UC system, and then earn a Ton of money each year. Big business in a campus setting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every international student at MIT that I knew, got a job in the USA if they wanted one. And they all got excellent jobs. I remember one colleague, years ago, from India who was receiving his PhD on his thesis work involving aircraft engine noise. He came to me: “Stag, I can’s seem to find a job in the few US jet engine companies.” I looked at him and said: “Forget them, head over to IBM. Have you ever noticed a business machine that made any noise in the various large companies across the USA? Who do you think IBM and other major companies want?” One interview at IBM and he had an Excellent job offer. Just Do It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For many colleges, especially some of the elite Private colleges, there will always be some standardized test that is required. Today that is the SAT or ACT. With the current pandemic, that may be “optional” for a while. And then places like the UC System with a huge number of applicants each year, will contract for their own standardized test and make money from the process. Less worrying and more enjoying school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a “safety college”, one that you should get admitted to: Go to SAT, AP, College Search and Admission Tools and use their search tools to find the 25% to 75% SAT/ACT scores. Then your score should be well in excess of the 75% score. Remember, that some colleges, like MIT, Harvard, Caltech, etc are Always a reach for all applicants even those with SAT 1600 or ACT 36 and are valedictorians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>STOP ASKING THESE PERMIT QUESTIONS. PERIOD. For every state in the USA, no one (No One) may drive alone on a Learners Permit. Period. End of discussion. You must follow the vast number of Restrictions on a learners permit, and if you violate one of those restrictions, All Hell comes down on you and not only do you lose your permit, it becomes a major flaw on your record. Follow the Regulations, and ALWAYS have a legally licensed adult over the age of 21 seated in the passenger seat of the car you are driving with a learner’s permit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good and perceptive question. However, in the USA, it typically will vary between the Private colleges and the large Public universities. At most (many) of the elite Private US colleges one is Not admitted to a major, but is admitted as a freshman to the college, and then selects a major prior to starting sophomore year at that college. And there are No restrictions in entering any major (or very few). However, some business programs in those colleges may require a special application, like Wharton at UPenn. Whereas, at most (many) of the large Public universities (U Maryland, U Delaware, and I believe UCLA, Berkeley, Texas, Michigan, etc.) one applies to both the university and the major. Here is one example: Mechanical Engineering | University of Delaware where one of our sons earned a bachelors degree in 2013. Let me see if I can find more internal insight and I will update my answer. But for places like MIT, Harvard and the 7 others in the Ivy Athletic League, Stanford, Caltech, etc. one merely applies to the college (Cornell University has 7 different undergraduate colleges, however) and not to a major, although a specific major may be in only one of those colleges….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be admitted to any elite Private US college, and especially one like Princeton, your academics have to be flawless. You are required to have excellent academic prowess across All course work and yet while Required it is Insufficient. 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character. And you must get several glowing letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that. And with all of that: How well will you fit-in with the Princeton undergraduate Community and what will you offer to that community outside of the classroom? and also: How well do you actually look in Orange?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the NASA GISS Goddard Institute for Space Studies is located at Columbia University. How long will it take you to commute from your house (from the moment you exit the door of your house to the moment you enter the correct building at Columbia University) to Columbia University and then return in the evening? If your family is wealthy, they can rent you a place to live in Manhattan and then you can have a great summer. Also, given the worldwide pandemic, the Summer of 2020 is not good for an internship that requires hours on public transit each day, and the Summer of 2021 maybe only marginally better. But if your Mom and Dad can swing an apartment for you in Manhattan close to Columbia than Go For It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No you have it all wrong. Combine Olympic boxing with Olympic Ice Hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. One does Not need elected officials using Politics to influence admissions to colleges. The colleges contract with the College Board and the business model is the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having two jobs can and most likely will result in some conflicts. And if you wanted to take a week for vacation (for example), you may not be able to coordinate the two jobs. Try to get by with one Vocation (career) and one Avocation that also pay some money and is more flexible. I am an aerospace engineer and a high level soccer referee where I can pick and choose my schedule, and I have a friend who is an aerospace engineer and a professional ski instructor on the Winter weekends.

<|startoftext|>It is your Car. Was the commercial cargo a human being or some other animal? Are people suing you for the loss of their commercial cargo that you were transporting? Did the commercial cargo that you were transporting contribute to the accident? If you answered no to all of those questions, then it is unlikely that your accident would be treated any differently than any other accident by your insurance company. A lot of people use their personal cars to assist in their business. Besides being an aerospace engineer, I referee college soccer and use my personal car to get to/from game assignments. I am the “commercial cargo” in that scenario as an independent contractor. Yet, if I had an accident, my insurance company would assist me. As long as you are not claiming the value of the commercial “cargo” in your accident filing with your insurance company, you should be fine. However, if you were driving for Lyft/Uber and had a paying passenger who got hurt in that accident, then you are in a Heap of Trouble!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could attend? Many could attend, academically. However, they only Should attend if they are a great Fit with the college and the college with them. Period.

<|startoftext|>Either you keep asking the same general question, or your Avatar is out there: Tom Stagliano's answer to How could I do one more year of NCAA athletics? I have done 4 years of college in 5 years (a year off) and 3 athletic seasons but I changed majors and want to transfer. I am 23 years old. You are now specifically “violating” what I stated, in that you want to go D-1 after three seasons of D-3 swimming in five years. Highly unlikely that you will get a waiver from the NCAA. And it is now much more obvious that you are doing this for the Scholarship money, which, at best would be a partial scholarship for one season. And with a waiver, most likely would be No scholarship. Instead, if you are a nationally ranked swimmer in your country (as you state you are from a foreign country) and were some type of NCAA record holder at the D-3 level, then get a Job with the D-1 college as an assistant coach while you are working on your degree. Easy. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch the TV show Portlandia (TV series) - Wikipedia to get a feel for the area. And then watch the show The O.C. - Wikipedia . to see how reflective that was of your experience if you lived South of LA near Orange County. I believe you will find that the Portland area will have people who are less transient, and while it may take slightly longer to make friends there than in the LA area, those friendships may last a whole lot longer. Just be respectful, ethical and friendly (but not Too friendly) and you will be fine. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The elite US private colleges are most interested in two things: Your academic prowess in that you can attend the college, survive freshman year, do well in a major and graduate in a timely manner: Required but Insufficient You as a whole Person and how well you work with others outside of the classroom and offer something to others outside of the classroom, and your overall fit with the college’s nominal undergraduate Community Playing sports, especially team sports, can go a long way to define how well you interact with others. But it is Not the only way. Granted, for MIT, 22% of the undergraduate students will play an intercollegiate sport, and in 2015, 60% (for example) of the admitted students had played an interscholastic sport in high school. But many did not. What do You have to offer to others and how well do you interact with and work with others outside of the classroom? Answer that question after some deep introspection and you will have your answer. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$3,000 every two weeks (26 pay periods) is a very good amount for a single adult who lives wisely in any city or region of Texas.

<|startoftext|>Noting (for others) that there are more NCAA D-3 student-athletes than all of the NCAA D-1 and D-2 student athletes combined. And people do NCAA D-3 sports because they: Love the sport, Love the team comradeship. Some of my best friends from MIT were my soccer or ice hockey team mates. You have played three seasons of a NCAA sport in five years from when you started college. You have not earned a bachelros degree yet, are changing majors and transferring and probably will spend another two academic years at that new college. Assuming you are a decent NCAA D-3 student athlete, then speak with the coach and if the coach likes you and your fit with the team, then the two of you will speak with the Athletic Director and if the AD agrees with your plan, the three of you can petition the NCAA for a waiver to let you play your 4th season at the new college. NOTE: It is unlikely to work at the NCAA D-1 or D-2 colleges. And at the NCAA D-3 level you first have to have the support of the League that the college is competing in. Many leagues may have more stringent rules than the NCAA. But, most colleges have club teams in many sports And, if you are a decent player but don’t get a waiver you might be able to become an assistant coach at the new college. I did that for soccer and ice hockey at MIT after my eligibility was over (graduate student). Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have your parents check with their insurance company. Many insurance companies will give a good Annual discount if the teenager has completed a drivers education course. The discount over 2 to 3 years could be a lot more than the cost of the drivers ed class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a sport for everyone across the USA who has access to ice. Back in the mid-1980’s two hockey buddies of mine from MIT were living in Los Angeles. They co-coached a team of U15 boys to a C-level national ice hockey championship. In the early 2000’s a co-worker of mine, living in Albuquerque, NM had a son playing youth ice hockey across New Mexico and Colorado. I have played a lot of ice hockey in the Los Angeles area. I believe some recent professional ice hockey players grew up in Florida or San Diego. If there is ice and people interested in ice hockey it catches on and the game flourishes. It is a Wonderful game once you play it a few times. Nothing like the bone-jarring thrill of ice hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is an excellent question, given there are many colleges worldwide, that, net, are less expensive than many of the public US colleges. We all know that there are two Public universities that are among the top twenty colleges in all of the USA (UCLA and Berkeley) and that many of the other public university flagship campuses are among the top fifty in the USA and among the top in the world. However, most of the Public US universities offer little in the way of financial aid for international students, and instead look to international students to pay in full and in cash with no financial aid. Yet, if you can afford it, you will get an excellent education, And be in the USA on a F-1 student visa and therefore can easily get that converted to a F-1 student visa to attend a Fully-Funded graduate research program at a world renown US research university. Granted, there are a few international students who attend some Public US universities on a partial or full athletic scholarship and that is great, and there are some scholarships specifically for international students that are funded by private money but awarded through the universities, so international students should check on that. Something to consider in the “big scheme of things”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, on a college exchange program, you are Not supposed to work in the foreign country, but to, instead, visit and tour the country when you are not doing school work. You are allowed to play sports and join and participate in clubs and activities. However, unless your exchange program includes a Co-Op job portion related to your college major, you will Not be working for pay during a 3 to 12 month exchange program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most if not all of the Public colleges will pay little or no attention to your high school transcript or even to which high school you attended if you have two good to very good years at a college when you attempt to transfer. Indeed, most public university systems are looking to the students in that state’s community colleges to have two good years of college course work and then transfer to the public university system as an example. However, most if not all of the elite Private US colleges, look very hard at your high school transcript, a mandatory cover letter from your high school guidance counselor (or head master), any required standardized tests (SAT/ACT and possibly some SAT Subject test scores) in addition to your college transcript, your extracurricular activities while you are in college (at the college and/or at the local extended area) and at least two glowing hot letters of recommendation from your current professors. It is far more difficult to transfer to an elite private college than it is to be admitted as a freshman applicant. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, but I never saw that from my high school teachers nor the high school teachers that our sons had (they graduated from high school in 2009 and 2010). Good public high schools have good teachers and they know how to encourage the student to stretch themselves and learn without overloading them with work. There are an amazing 168 hours in every week and slightly more than 52 weeks in each year, so it is up to the individual student to learn how to manage all of that time while always being cognizant of their health. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should Always be an Excellent role model for all of your children. Do not expect your children to do something “different” from how you do that. That means be a positive role model for respect, ethics, work ethic, honesty, hard work, volunteering, responsible drinking of alcoholic beverages following the local laws, responsible taking of drugs per the local laws and never taking illegal drugs. That is your starting point at your child’s day one and will last at least the next 22+ years. When they are in high school you are then Only involved if your child asks you to be involved or if the school requests your involvement. Otherwise, remain cognizant, but not at the school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is currently no function in the USAF for an astronaut. However, well over 300 astronauts have been in the USAF when they entered the astronaut corps. Today, USAF candidate would “leave” the USAF and become a member of NASA as an astronaut, and then later could return to the USAF, I believe. But the USAF and any of the US military corps do Not have positions for active astronauts. Astronauts are now members of NASA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. You should work directly with your child’s pediatrician to determine which vaccinations are required for your child, and when, and if your child’s health condition may prevent the child from taking certain vaccines. There are medical conditions that would preclude someone from getting a vaccination, therefore you Must work with your child’s doctor. If anything, we delayed our children getting some vaccines by a year or two to allow their systems to mature a bit, but they had all of their required vaccines prior to starting school.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They see a win-win situation. They quickly appease the California residents from under-performing California public schools who claim the SAT/ACT tests are racially biased. They aren’t, but the UC system will look like a hero. And it will make the UC system a Ton of new money. Each year the UC system enrolls over 55,000 freshmen and in that process receives over 110,000 applications each year. The UC system will develop their own special entrance test (most likely by the companies who currently write the SAT/ACT tests…) and charge Money to take the test. If the UC system makes $20 for every test, and 200,000 people take the California test every year, that is a cool $4 million the UC injects into their system. Nice!!!! Win-win-win….. (as the testing companies will make money and probably replace the SAT/ACT with future versions of the UC inspired test….. Welcome to Capitalism at its finest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can Not apply for a F-1 student visa until you have been Accepted by a school or college and that school has provided you with an I-20 form.

<|startoftext|>Scores? No. The SAT/ACT is very basic and by far most MIT applicants have no difficulty with those basic tests that barely test 10th grade abilities. However, MIT will take into consideration, for the Fall of 2020, if you were unable to take the SAT test due to test date cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if SAT/ACT tests are available, then MIT will expect that you take one of those two and do very well. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course. I was taught early on by my parents to be Frugal and to always have at least a 6 month reserve in cash in a bank savings account. When I finally completed graduate school, I had a 3 month reserve (living like a graduate student) and I steadily increased that to 6 months within two years. Then before having children, my wife and I made certain we had close to a 12 month reserve.

<|startoftext|>I would hope Not, see below. It is up to the Student (in grade 5 and beyond) to Learn. Period. If the student lost their way in the last 25% of the 2019–20 school year, then it is up to that Middle School or High School student to Figure It Out, as they should. Whereas, for the 1st - 4th grade students, there may be some things for which they still must be specifically Taught. They will need to Ask their teacher for some specific assistance and may be arrange to stay after school for an hour twice per week to drill on some specific skill-set for which they are struggling to self-learn as they should by the time they get to Middle School where everyone is a Self Learner that uses the resources about them including the teachers/professors. The tough ones will be the 5th grade student that should be self-sufficient but hasn’t quite grasped the concept. Those that are truly Special Needs students. However, they get extra assistance anyway and everything should be appropriately covered. I would imagine that 90% of those who fell-behind, will be back on track before the end of the following school year. It is the 10% that may have to take an extra year in school before graduating from high school, but so be it. It would be the same for those in college. There is no cost to attending public school, and many take 14 years to complete a 13 year program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a F-1 student visa, then you can study in the USA for as long as a college allows you to study at the college, you are considered a full-time student, and you are making progress towards a degree. However, most exchange students come to the USA for their “junior year” and then will return to their college to finish their last year and to graduate with a bachelors degree. Then many of them will apply to US colleges for a graduate degree and get another F-1 student visa to be a graduate student. It is always possible, that if you come to the USA for junior year as an exchange student, that you could petition/apply to the US college to be admitted as a transfer student and then your F-1 visa would continue. However, that may “violate” some agreement between the US college and the international college from which you were in attendance for the first few years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be tough. A rocket must be launched from a FAA-licensed facility and the “reentry” vehicle with the payload must land at a FAA-licensed facility, and by current FAA licensing standards the flight can Not go over populated areas……. Therefore if you are launching from the USA West Coast to Hawaii over the ocean, maybe it would be something to consider. However, what has to go from LA or San Francisco to Hawaii that quickly? And what would the Russian and Chinese satellites think of a rocket launch along that flight path???? Cargo jets can carry a lot and get to many places around the world fairly quickly. Tough sell on an effective cost basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is going to question this mob? Duke is very good, Believe It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. In my time interviewing applicants to MIT, I came across a few who were applying during junior year because they would have completed all of their requirements to earn a high school diploma by the end of their junior year. Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Repeat Senior, etc., are merely terms related to your Age, and have Nothing to do with how long it takes you to complete the requirements to earn a high school diploma. Work well and politely with your high school guidance counselor to move correctly forward to successfully apply to colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh? COVID-19 reduced your grade??? By March 16, 2020 when many/most schools moved to online education 70% of the school year was complete, and from my recollection, the last 25% of a school year is primarily for review, wrapping up projects and taking the final exam. Therefore, I find it hard to believe that the pandemic resulted in your getting a C grade in two courses. And Yes, it will, as it should, affect your ability to get into an elite Private US university, because by the time you are in Fifth grade, you are supposed to be a Learner and able to learn on your own using all of the resources around you, including teachers. But it is up to you to manage your time and learning path well. Have a Long and Polite discussion about all of this with your guidance counselor as your counselor will write a Mandatory letter of recommendation on your behalf which will discuss you as both a student and as a whole Person. If there were mitigating circumstances, then your guidance counselor can include those in that letter. If not, then work hard on your back-up plan. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In Massachusetts the girls and boys play high school soccer in the Fall. The girls play volleyball in the Fall and the boys play Volleyball in the Spring (space restrictions indoors). So, a female soccer player would have to decide whether to play soccer or volleyball in the Fall and MUST attend the ten day pre-season try-outs in August. Period. However, any summer work-outs are up to the student-athlete and by State Law can NOT be a consideration for making the team. Only the results of the 10-day pre-season try-out period can be considered. Therefore, if you are a female in Massachusetts and want to play volleyball in the Fall and play soccer most of the Summer you would be fine. Also in Massachusetts no public high school student is allowed to play two sports during the same season. One high school sport Period in one season, and if you are playing a high school sport you are not allowed to play an amateur sport during the same season that would interfere in Any way with the high school sport. Simple. Win-win. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

Don’t shun the school and then want the attributes that go with the school. Sorry. Sign up for town-sponsored or church sponsored youth sports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both our sons in 2013 and 2014, got their bachelors degrees and then became completely independent at 22.

Whereas if you are actually at Northeastern University, they have a 5-year Co-Op program where you take four years of courses spread over five years and there are three six-month paying Co-Op jobs related to your major interspersed.

<|startoftext|>Assuming that all you have is a Learners Permit, you can’t. If you have a learner’s permit, then you MUST have an licensed adult (over the age of 21) in the car’s passenger seat who is responsible for your driving training. When our sons were teenagers and learning to drive on learners permits, I had them pass my road test before I allowed them to take the state’s road test. By then they had driven in all weather conditions and types of roads in our region, had a least 100 hours of driving experience as a learner and could: Parallel park on the left or the right, either up hill or down hill and between two cars. Execute a 3-point turn on a narrow road with no curbs and a drop-off on both sides Back-up the car along side a curb for 100 feet while staying within 12 inches of the curb and not touching the curb We started parallel parking training behind one car only. You need a car, and not “cones” because you have to get a feel of where the other car is. Finally we progressed to parallel parking between two cars with 8 extra feet, 6 feet and finally 4 feet. Take that slowly since you could damage your car or the other cars. At all times when you park, your tires (closest to the curb-line) should be within 12 inches of the curb or you Failed your parking. Get a licensed adult to work with you. Start on a quiet suburban street with another car from your “friends or family” that you will park behind. Then introduce a couple of tall trash barrels to represent the second car, and start the barrels the length of your car plus 8 feet at first, and work your way down to 4 feet of extra space. Do it on the right side of the road and on the left side of the road. Then find some real parking spaces on a busy urban street and try to parallel park uphill and downhill. Good luck and enjoy the process. Driving should be Fun!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is up to You to research the colleges, first online to reduce the list, and then to Visit colleges that are within a one-day (8 hour) drive of where you live.

Are you claiming that Both of those extremes are what you are seeking for four years of college?

High school interscholastic sports are merely one way of doing that. However, amateur club sports that have a similar or more extensive commitment are equally as good if not better. NOTE: That club sport should be something that you have actively done during high school age. Also, don’t forget to the get a supplemental letter of recommendation from your club’s coach/manager. That letter can be sent directly to the colleges (if they allow it) or directly to your high school guidance counselor who can include that information in the cover letter that your guidance counselor must sent along with your official transcript to the colleges and will discuss you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person.

<|startoftext|>UCs….. Those are the ten campuses of the University of Californian system: University of California So, to get financial aid from a Public college in California, typically you have to be: A resident of California and in great need of financial aid A highly recruited athlete who receives an athletic scholarship (around 3% or less and most are partial awards) A non-resident of CA who is truly brilliant and the UC system wants to lure that person to an UC campus and away from the elite private US colleges. Well less that 1% So, are you or your parents currently residents of California? If not, then are one of the 3.5% of the others (a recruited athlete or someone that an UC is trying to lure to their campus)? Otherwise be ready to pay $75,000 per year (total cost) to attend an UC campus. Check out the colleges in the country where you currently are studying. Good luck. NOTE: As an US citizen, if you fill-out the FAFSA forms than you may qualify for some Federal aid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I claim that a child is actually Taught in 4th grade and before. Once the child is in 5th grade (and beyond) the child is a Learner and Learns on their own, using the resources around them: teachers, parents, peers, books, internet, etc. Someone knowledgeable in the Art of teaching is required to lay the Foundation of the education: reading, spelling, speaking, basic numbers, arithmetic, concept of history and civics, basic science and technology and social interaction. That very important foundation requires special teaching abilities that many parents do not have, especially if the child has any difficulties with any portions of the foundation. Therefore, for 5th grade and beyond the teachers and parents are working together as part of the overall set of resources that the Learner uses. Whereas, in K-4th grade (certainly thru 3rd grade) the main source for establishing that foundation is the teacher with assistance from the parents. Thus with online education, at under 10 years old, the parents support the teachers. At 10 and older, they all support the child who is an independent learner, as long as the foundation was built properly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pads? I believe you will have difficulty with TSA if you arrive like this: or if you have these under your “shirt” Whereas if you wear these padded items: No one will complain. Enjoy your flight, and hopefully you won’t need to use those pads…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not enough detail. Where do your parents or legal guardian live? Are your parents in the US military, are residents of that US state, and your family has been living on US military bases in foreign countries for the last several years? Are your parents in the US diplomatic corps, are residents of that US state, and your family has been living at an US Embassy or Consulate in foreign countries for the last several years? There are many variations on your question. Typically, if you are a “normal age” college applicant, your Parents have to be residents of that state for at least one Full year before you can attend that public college with in-state tuition. However there are a number of atypical scenarios. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Holland if you believe your daughter will love to brew ale, then yes. Otherwise, give her a great (much better) middle name so she can use that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never Lie. Typically (when I played sports) there was One captain of a team (just like one captain of a ship) and the Captain appointed one or two Assistant Captains. If the team’s captain appointed you to assist in leading the defense or offense (or some other assistance), then you were an Assistant Captain. Otherwise, merely a team member and then focus on “starter or first-off-the-bench” etc . and how you assisted the Team as well as being a good athlete. NOTE: Today, in high school we all know that being team captain is a popularity contest and parents are willing to hire lawyers to get their child a captaincy….. Instead, focus on the Quality of your membership on that team and get a very good supplemental letter of recommendation from the coach or have the coach send info to your guidance counselor to be in the cover letter for your official transcript. Good luck, and NEVER lie, as it will come back to haunt you…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. Most colleges require their freshman to live in approved college living spaces Unless they have a signed agreement from the freshman’s parents. However, no, if the freshman is a 23 year old who recently had an honorable discharge from the US military. If you are 17/18 heading to college, you are trying to transition from being a raw teenager into an adult, and the college wants to assist you in that process, at least for the first year. Especially since, on average, the US society is horribly litigious and does not use common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the travel restrictions, you probably can’t volunteer with Doctors Without Borders in a Syrian refugee camp nor a West African Ebola clinic. However, after speaking with your doctor, contact your town hall or city hall and look for volunteering opportunities or check with the local hospital for volunteering opportunities. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not if you are discussing Unweighted GPA out of 4.0 That should be Obvious. However, if you are discussing weighted GPA where the maximum could be as high as 4.8, then you can do the math if you expect to get a weighted GPA of 4.0. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not if you can buy all of your tickets and pay for any hotel rooms in Cash. Otherwise a 17 year old in the USA is not an adult and can not have their own credit card in their name. And it is difficult to buy an airplane ticket with cash or pay for a hotel in cash, besides the danger of carrying all that cash with you……. And if the parents don’t approve of the trip, they can declare you a run-away, and you will be picked up by the police, held in jail over night and then reunited with your oh so happy parents……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not defending the decision, only stating the relative truth: From age 5 to 25 the death rate from COVID-19 is (roughly) 1 out of 10,000 which is the same (1 out of 10,000) as it was for that age group from Measles before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, and children went to summer camps and played sports prior to 1963 and is the same (1 out of 10,000) for the suicide rate of 17 to 25 year old students and families still encourage their children to attend college. The Problem is if the child contracts the virus, is asymptomatic, brings it home and kills off the older family members………. It is really more about the self-preservation of the parents, and aunts/uncles and grand parents. Therefore, a personal decision of the parents…… The governor sees the glass as half-full and others see it as half-empty. But if you are a parent over the age of 50, then think Long and Hard about that…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because the student is on that campus 24x7 when a college student, and that student is with those peer students of that college’s undergraduate community 24x7. If the student hates the campus, the surrounding area, and can’t stand the other students then they are setting themselves up to fail or worse to be in continual depression. That is why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. An exchange student is a legal student in that US public high school and therefore eligible to play any of the interscholastic sports that are offered.

<|startoftext|>Maybe, if you are the Leader of your debate team. Leadership is a quality that all of the elite private US colleges desire: Read this article, the links and especially the report (see link): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions As the many top colleges in the USA got together in 2016 to tell people what they expect from successful freshman applicants.

<|startoftext|>More illustrations of the Litigious nature of the US society. The US has way too many lawyers per the number of people in the USA. It is quite possible that Any student who is discovered to be part of that class action law suit will Not be admitted by most colleges. No need to have litigious students on campus. As for the law suit: there will be a settlement (in many years), the lawyers will get most of the money and the students will get very little and if they get anything it will be Years from now. Dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was a student athlete at MIT (soccer and ice hockey) and we got no financial aid or any money for the sports we played, indeed we had to Spend money to play those sports. And there are More NCAA D-3 student-athletes than all of the D-1 and D-2 athletes combined. Perks? If you considered 24 hours per week or more associated with your sport as a perk…… Friends? We call those Team Mates. Indeed playing any sport (including intramural sports) is a great way to socialize. Try getting out of your dorm room and playing some sports with your mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From what I see in my state (Massachusetts), one should Not take biology in high school until one has completed a course in high school chemistry. Proper biology (today) will contain a lot of bio-chemistry. And, yes, take the honors version of all courses. That is what I did in high school. At the elite colleges, All courses are “honors”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Most engineering colleges will require all of the students to take Calculus as a freshman at college. That will either reinforce what you learned in high school or present it to you for the first time. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After? None What changed after 50 MILLION people died worldwide from the 1918 flu pandemic? There was a Summer Olympics in 1920, and airlines were flying passengers and ships were carrying passengers and all of the professional sports operated with fans in the stadiums. And there was No (zero) vaccine. Same thing. By 2022 you will asking: “what pandemic?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spike? No, it will SPIKE in early November and then all “Hell” will break out by Thanksgiving. That is why many colleges if they open their campuses, will start early and finish the Fall term prior to Thanksgiving. Simple. There were three waves to the 1918 flu pandemic that killed 50 MILLION people world wide and this will be the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Generally, yes. I have seen people “let go” at various businesses that I deal with. The person is called into the human resources person’s office, told of their being let go, and they are given a few boxes and must remove all personal possessions immediately and leave before the end of the business day (ASAP). Typically the company’s security personnel assist, or if it is a small business, then a security agency assists for that day. The business issues a check immediately for all remaining pay that the person is owed, and for any unused personal leave time that is able to be cashed-in. The employee is offered a COBRA health insurance option, and is told that their health insurance company will contact them within a week to work out payment. The employee turns in all company possessions. While the employee is in with human resources, the employee’s company credit cards are cancelled and the employee’s access to the company’s computer network is terminated. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No bank or financial institution gives out personal loans with no collateral (other than a student loan that is guaranteed to be repaid by the US Federal government). Therefore, if you need $10,000 then you merely get a credit card that has a credit limit of $10,000 or higher (preferably higher). But you will be paying upwards of 18% for interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IN order to fully accept admission to a college you must: Tell the college Yes, and pay the nonrefundable deposit.

<|startoftext|>There really is not much you can do, if you all are legal room mates in an apartment or shared house.

It is merely simple room mate courtesy. Otherwise, since you are the one at risk, you may need to search for another place to live that is safer for you. And use wipes to clean public surfaces in your shared public space as that is the responsibility of the user before using. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

Passenger safety tips Child Passenger Safety - AAA Digest of Motor Laws And you will note that any “child” who is 13 or older can easily and legally sit in a front passenger seat…. My goodness there are some states that allow a 15 year old to have a learner’s permit and they are allowed to sit in the Driver’s seat with an airbag Much closer to them than in a passenger seat. Indeed, from this picture: it is Obvious, that if the passenger keeps their seat fully towards the rear (all the way back) and is wearing their seat belt and shoulder restraint, that they will never even be touched by the airbag that is a Supplemental Restraint for the Idiots who do not wear their seat belts and shoulder restraints. Indeed, I would feel safe with an 8 year old of normal height and weight in the front passenger seat with the seat all the way back and properly wearing their seat-belt and shoulder harness.

If it continues or is worse than the typical Italian ethnic hair-scuff or ear lobe twist, then tell an authority figure at your school, as they know who to contact in your US state. For places outside of the USA, still seek an authority figure outside the home, Good luck.<|endoftext|>

However, I can not speak for non-elite Private US colleges nor any of the US public colleges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it could. I believe when a company asks to use H1B employees it has to specifically tell the US government why there are no US applicants with similar qualifications. With the high unemployment rate currently in the USA due to the pandemic, that will be tough to document. Similarly, with all of the unemployed US citizens and permanent residents, why would anyone consider hiring an H4EAD person???? Really??? Also, the USA is currently discouraging business related travel, so why would anyone need a B-1 visa? And there is a general “lock-down” in the USA and discouraging travel for vacation/recreation so why would the USA grant any B-2 tourist visas to “tour where”??? It should open up again in 2022. Just a two year wait. I am certainly not touring around the world until 2022 and business trips internationally Maybe in 2021. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Actually, Georgia Tech is a large Public four-year university…… But we will forgive you. The issue is STEM focus versus Liberal Arts Centered. I attended MIT and there were students in the liberal arts and we all had to take humanities and social sciences courses, but deep down it was STEM centered and filled with “nerds”. In a very good way. (And CalTech will be Uber Nerdy…) For example, one of my sons (graduated college in 2013) wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer and was admitted to WPI and to University of Delaware (among other colleges). WPI is a cousin to MIT and is super-STEM centered. Whereas UDel has a great Engineering program but is filled with liberal arts and other majors. I recommended and he wanted to attend UDel and become a Fighting Blue Hen and I was totally supportive, because I knew he needed that wide range of students on campus and the wide range of non-engineering activities. He thrived, did very well and has an excellent engineering career. But he probably would Not have been happy at WPI. The key is finding the best fit for the Student. The best college in the world could be the worst college for an individual if the fit is bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Expelled? I attended K-12 in a small upstate NY public school system and No one was ever expelled in that 13 years. Indeed in my 8th grade home room we had three (3) boys (men) who were 21 years old (students). And I remember when one of them turned 21. We were on the 2nd floor of the school building directly over an asphalt area. Two of those 21 year old 8th grade students took the other (birthday “boy”) and holding him by his ankles, dangled him from the windows of our home room and passed him from window to window to celebrate his birthday. Not only were they Not expelled, Nothing happened. Just a routine birthday celebration……. Please, only warped minds expel students. If there is Real Discipline in the school system there is never a reason to expell a student. And if the student commits a real crime the student is placed in jail or remanded to a juvenile detention facility, but that is not an expulsion. And when they are released from jail they were right back in home room with us, entertaining us with the stories. Never expel a student. Discipline them, and teach them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honor classes??? At a college like MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc. all of the classes are honor classes……. Of course, if you are admitted to a Public University, some will have a small honors college within the university.

More like what is normally done at MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc. So, Yes, take the honors courses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are 24 or older, then your parents do not have to put data into your FAFSA forms. So, if you are under 24 your parents have to fill-out a Large part of your FAFSA forms. However, the Federal government allows your parents to keep some savings which is Not expected to be used to pay for your college education. Whereas any money in your name is expected to be available to pay for your college education. These are rough numbers for illustration. Assume your parents have $60,000 in savings and you have $5,000 In the Fall of your senior year your parents give you $20,000, so they have $40,000 and you have $25,000. Bad. Because you submit your FAFSA forms in February of senior year. If your parents only had $60,000 in savings, the Fed would expect that none of that money would be used for your education (an example from years ago), and therefore there is only $5,000 in cash to use towards your college education. But with the gift, your parents $40,000 is not considered for your education, But you now have $25,000 and all of that is considered towards your education. Bad planning. Sit down with a financial adviser who understands the Current (2020) thinking behind the FAFSA equations. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is normal (or at least it was for me) A science, a history, a literature, a foreign language, and a mathematics course. Typical.

NOTE One should take high school chemistry Before taking biology. Typical course load.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is a small percentage of Whiners who were pampered as children who can’t get along with college room mates. There were roughly 250 students in my dorm at MIT, and I was on the dorm’s judicial committee for three years and chairman as a senior. We did all of the room assignments each year and we mediated all room mate disputes. There were a few, but with some simple discussions we were able to solve most if not all disputes. And a few times we were able to swap room mates. Indeed, no one in my very large extended family ever had any room mate issues in college. None. Simple. Be an Adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA: Yes. But because of public school Busing, that is almost impossible. There was No public school busing where I attended public school. Therefore all of my schools K-12) started at the civil time of 8:30 am. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh So, simple: Get your public schools to Get Rid of school busing to/from school. And many of my class mates walked upwards of 2 miles one way (including Kindergarten) or took the public bus with everyone else. Simple!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are a Canadian citizen applying to be a Graduate student at an US university, there are No differences, except you will still need to get a F-1 student visa (using the college’s provide I-20 form) to become a student in the USA. About 40% or more of the US graduate research students are international, and many from Canada. However, to apply to be an Undergraduate student (typically a freshman) at an elite US private university, then there is a Major difference: Most (if not all) of the elite private US colleges have a self-imposed Quota on the number of International students as part of the college’s undergraduate community. That varies from 8% to 12%. Then, during the admission process, there are two Pools of freshman applicants: US: citizens, permanent residents, legal refugees International You would be in the International pool of freshman applicants and therefore only competing with the international applicants for an admission. Additionally, there are only five US colleges that are Need-Blind for the admission of an international freshman applicant: MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Amherst College. All of the other US colleges will hold asking for any financial aid against you during the freshman admissions process. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will vary from state to state, and even within a state, it may be affected by local city laws. And there is a difference for a landlord in a two or three-family home where the landlord lives in one of the units, and a landlord who merely owns an apartment building. One will assume that the landlord will seek legal counsel and then following the local laws, file to evict you. It is possible in that process that the landlord will wait a period of time, change the locks and then force you to go to court to get your possessions back. In that process it is always possible that the judge will required you to pay some portion of what you owe in order to gain access to your possessions. HOWEVER: Please seek legal advice from a lawyer in your state and locality within that state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a degree that covers two disciplines. For example, peruse this: Interdisciplinary Programs and you will see this dual degree: MIT LGO | Dual Degree | Masters Engineering Management Program And the HASS has a dual degree path: MIT SHASS: Undergraduate Studies and then there are double majors: Double majors | MIT Registrar As I and many others have stated numerous times, MIT has it all, and if it doesn’t, and you work Politely with MIT, MIT will create it.

<|startoftext|>If I had a small business, I would buy an online service that is well secured (and reputable) in the “cloud”. Then you do all of your book-keeping online, and you can mirror that to a local (secure) back-up set of hard drives. Do Not trust a laptop with that secure company info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot? One should take some time to check out the neighborhood prior to buying. That means driving by a few times at different times of the day. And then there are no guarantees. You could have Wonderful neighbors on both sides of your new house for the first two years, and then they sell and Horrible neighbors move in. Just make certain that you check with the town for Zoning clauses/laws, and noise rules. And make certain you buy a house with Lots of space between your house and each house near-by, and then be willing to build a nice (but expensive) fence around your yard. Good fences make good neighbors…… And so does a lot of space and good zoning laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>0%???? Only if they charged a HUGE fee upfront to initiate the loan. If you were to borrow $10,000 from a bank at 5% and pay it back over ten years, you would pay $2,728 in interest, but spread over ten years. Maybe the bank would loan you money but charge you 25% up front. So, if you borrowed $10,000 they would give you only $7,500 and you would pay back the $10,000 over ten years at $83.34 per month. A bank may be willing to do that….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For the USA, car insurance is controlled/regulated by each state. In Massachusetts, the insurance companies contact the state government and asked if it was OK to offer a rebate. The government regulatory agency said yes and checks were mailed to the policy owners. However, I would have preferred that I just got a Credit, since I will need to pay for insurance (next annual premium) soon. Indeed, many insurance companies are Mutuals, and you could get a rebate at the end of the premium year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>10,000 miles is 8,690 nautical miles Here is a great circle mapping app that is doing 8690nm@jfk Great Circle Mapper And you will see that only the gray areas are farther than 8,690 nm or 10,000 miles. Therefore, that would only be a JFK to Perth Australia flight. Even JFK to Singapore is less than 10,000 miles by great circle direct route. Great Circle Mapper Update: I am proving the minimum distance great circle route which is not the minimum flight distance given air routes (thank you Wendy Moncur) and as Julian Brelsford pointed out, the great circle route from London to Sydney is over 10,500 miles: Great Circle Mapper<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are a female in the USA and are asking if you should join the high school varsity team as a senior to learn more about the game, then No. However, if you go to college, there should be intramural softball. That is where I learned to play men’s fast pitch softball and then there were community teams and eventually D-1 men’s amateur fast pitch softball. If you “know the essence of the game of baseball”, then you can pick up softball basics very easily, unless you want to be a pitcher. All of the other positions are actually easier in softball than in baseball. (I played catcher and 2nd base in fast pitch softball and catcher and outfield in baseball). If there is a town softball league for high school students then go for it. Otherwise wait for college intramural sports and play on a men’s team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One year? Try two years, and attend your local community college with the correct pre-planning to be admitted directly into your state’s top public university system as a junior. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are organized, then you should apply early action. A place like MIT loves that in an applicant, as that states that the applicant really believes they are a good fit with MIT and that MIT is a good fit for them. I applied Early Action to MIT as it was my first choice, and when I was admitted early (back then) just prior to Thanksgiving, it was a Huge relief. I could then focus on my studies and enjoying the remaining months of high school without worrying about college admissions. Apply early if you can. However, if you apply Early Decision be very wary of the Contract that you and your parents must sign and any restrictions that must be observed. Early action has no contract and no restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check with community colleges in your locality and see if there is a college course that you can take to satisfy that one high school course that you need. Work with your guidance counselor. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dual enrollment??? Health and How to be Successful Student???? Wow, you are way to analytical in your approach to high school. Of course with the pandemic there won’t be much to do this Summer and the Community Colleges will be closed and online so you might as well sit and home and learn about health and how to succeed in school without over-trying. Merely, be a good student, ask questions before and after class and after school, and join some activities that you love to do, and do those well and work well with others. Enjoy the next four years as they should be Excellent. And don’t over analyze high school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By “making a millions dollars” I believe you mean having a million dollars in the bank in cash, while having a place to live, and feeding yourself and family etc. Someone who earns $40,000 per year as a starting salary with 2% raises per year will have earned $1,000,000 in 21 years, but may have saved very little. Whereas a senior aerospace engineer can easily earn $150,000 per year and with nominal pay increases will have earned $1,000,000 in seven years. A million dollars is not that much money today……. Many homes in the suburbs of Boston sell for over $2 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Massachusetts here are the admission requirements for a “tier 2” public college in the state: First-Year Admission Requirements You will note that they expect a 1070 or higher SAT score for a GPA of 2.4 If that is the same as in your state, then head to a community college and use those two years to whip yourself into academic shape for your future major, and then with good pre-planning, you will be admitted directly to your state’s top public university system as a junior. Good luck. Here are two examples: Massachusetts: MassTransfer | UMass Amherst California: Transfer admission guarantee (TAG)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see. Over 50 MILLION people died in the 1918 flu and all of the air travel as we know it was around from 1920 to the beginning of 2020. So, by 2022, I expect it to look like it did in 2019, but with fewer potential passengers…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This summer? In the summer of 2020 during the pandemic with no medicine and no vaccine, there is No guarantee that you will be able to travel from country to country. Lock-down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only for parties not traveling together. Whereas two parents and one of their children should be in the three seats together. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question will be: For the youth sports, with the pandemic raging, what Adults will be assisting with this, with direct contact with the youth? Umpires and referees and coaches. If you are talking about the athletes being 9 to 17 years old and the coaches and umpires/referees being 18 to 22 years old, then fine. That 9 to 22 year old age group has a 0.05% chance of dying from the COVID-19 virus, which is the same death rate for measles before the vaccine was distributed in 1963. No big deal. So, 22 (may be 25) and younger? Fine, go for it. However, if they get sick (symptomatic or asymptomatic) they are Not allowed to be with anyone older than 30, so they need to find a place to recuperate away from parents. Easy, rent dormitories for the summer and let the 9 to 25 year olds move in and play sports and other activities and recuperate among themselves if they get the virus. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this intern crap…. One needs a summer Job or a Co-Op job or a Job-Job. In the summer before junior year in college and Earlier, merely get a Job for the work ethic experience, the experience of working with different people (team work) and to make some Money. Direct relationship with your future major is not that important. Then in the summer before senior year of college, you try to get a job that is directly related to your major, because someone who has completed junior year of college Actually Knows something that is useful to an employer. I highly recommend, overloading a couple of classes sophomore year or taking a summer class, and then doing a 6 to 7 month Co-Op in the second term of junior year (Feb - August). Several months directly related to your future career. Then once you have Graduated from college, if you don’t go directly to graduate school, then your first job is typically an “internship” that is a 3 to 6 months of work for Pay, but with no guarantee of a full-time employment after the agreed upon period. Many small companies (and large) use this as a means to “try before you buy”. Simple and easy. So if it is before junior year of college, then just “get a Job” for the work ethic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is legal and ethical for a someone who is hiring people to check the Public record of the person. And Facebook and Twitter are Public postings. And since the applicant Knows this, then the public portion of their Twitter and Facebook accounts should be the best they can be. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an aero-astro major I put together a “minor” with Economics and Political Science. Engineering is a business and one needs to understand economics to understand business decisions. And if you are doing any work for the government, then politics will influence many of the decisions so understanding history and political science is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. The YF-16 beat out the YF-17 for the USAF competition becoming the single engine F-16. Whereas the Navy, back then (pre F-35C), insisted on a dual engine aircraft and McDonnell-Douglas took the dual-engine YF-17 concept from Northrop (switching primes, because McDAC was considered a Naval aircraft contractor) and Northrop became the subcontractor and they built the F-18 for the Navy. Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was faced with that decision. I could attend a brand new public high school with my friends a half-mile walk from my house, or attend an excellent Catholic boys school 6 miles away for free (full scholarship). I did Not want to attend an all-boys school (life is co-ed) and I did not want to have to rise early to take a public bus to that Catholic high school. So, I attended the local new public school and that made all the difference in the world. I am very certain that my attending that public high school paved my path to attend MIT. Go with what is best for You. And go Co-Ed if possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of the USAF fighter jets use JP-8 fuel which is very similar to Jet-A which is used by the airliners. The USAF is trying to convert to use Jet-A, because there are a lot of USAF bases that are co-located with commercial airports (Eglin AFB and Kirtland AFB are merely two of Many). Air Force completes historic fuel conversion Whereas the Navy uses JP-5 and it is unlikely that the Navy will want to switch to JP-8 as the JP-5 tends to be safer for carriage/storage on aircraft carriers. I know the Army is trying to go to one fuel (JP-8) for all of its helicopters and ground vehicles so that it only has to move one-type of fuel across the battlefield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At 16 years old, you are supposed to be in school. OK, you missed a year due to a family tragedy. Now go back to your school (or to the current school in your new school district if you relocated) and work with the guidance department to find the classes you need to take. More than likely, you will be a “junior” taking sophomore year classes, and you will have “two senior years” before you graduate. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the state of the pandemic on local areas, do two things: Contact your doctor and ask if you have any underlying medical conditions that would make getting the COVID-19 virus dangerous for you (age and health) If you are a normal 16 to 22 year old and therefore have 0.05% or less chance of dying from the virus, then contact your town hall or city hall and volunteer to assist where needed. Most of that will be for pay. Be part of the solution. Also, “It takes a Village”, so check for ways to assist in your local neighborhood as well. There are 168 hours in each week, and you can easily work 40 hours per week and help in the neighborhood for 20 hours per week. Good luck and enjoy the Summer and be careful on returning to your home so you don’t infect others who may be more vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colleges are looking for people who get along very well with others and who work well with others in a team setting. If you are whining about being bullied, then it is obvious that you haven’t figured out how to work well with others. What is looked for and seen as favorable is a story about how you Were bullied but managed to understand the dynamics of the situation and turned it around and then worked well with the others and/or became good friends with the others. Been there, done that. and that is what college admissions officers want to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$10 USD Five ones and one five dollar bill. That is more than sufficient for what they would need to buy. If what they need costs more, they would speak with their parents and work together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will assume you are a resident of Florida and looking at two very good public universities that also will provide you with in-state tuition costs. Speak with your guidance counselor. The counselors have the historical data on the students from your school who applied to either FSU or UF and for those who were admitted, what was their GPA and SAT score. Use the resource that is provided to you. Also, go to University & College Search Tool and register for Free and use that database for some guidance. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on how your guidance counselor writes it up in the mandatory cover-letter that is sent to the colleges along with your official transcript and school report. In order to find the “flaw” in the school’s network, you must have been doing some illegal work on the school’s network, and maybe since you have merely gotten better at network hacking without getting caught…….. If the counselor writes anything like that, regardless of your spotless “record” since, you will be down-graded during admissions…… Speak at length with your guidance counselor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming there is no “dress code” where you will be, then yes. However, personally, as someone over the age of 16, I would Never wear the jersey of Any team, unless the team gave me the jersey for some reason. I used to practice with the LA Kings NHL team, and I still wouldn’t wear their jersey because I didn’t feel I earned it (they used to play with us prior to the start of their pre-season practice). However, that is merely my sentiment. Feel free to wear a NFL Cowboys jersey, but please, if you are 17 or older, fill-it-out well and know something about football.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Typically, No. In general, the course work offered at a community college is only at the level of freshman and sophomore level courses at the four year university. What you might be able to do, is to spend three years at the community college taking a wide range of courses (towards two different majors) and then spending another two years at the university and getting a dual degree in the two majors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, you are allowed to pass through security the day of your flight. If your flight is at 11 pm (23:00 European time) and the TSA lines open at 5 am (18 hours prior to the scheduled flight time) you can enter because it is the same day. Most airports, now, have a curfew, and there are almost no 1 am flights any more, so that should not be an issue. Enjoy your flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, yes. If you change your state of residence from Ohio to Florida, then you must follow the laws and regulations of the state of Florida. Enjoy your new residence in Florida and take the one year time to actually learn how to drive in all weather conditions, on all types of roads, day/night, etc. with a responsible licensed adult sitting in the front passenger seat. You will be licensed to drive a 4,000+ pound Weapon, and remember that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I separate an athlete’s sport’s performance from their real life “antics”. Additionally, I separate an Actor’s performance from their real life antics, etc. For example, I can thoroughly enjoy a performance by Jane Fonda and not consider her early life horrible political antics during the Vietnam War that cost the lives of several prisoners of war……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically: No. Indeed, that is why most if not all of the elite private US colleges do Not have majors as freshmen and the students select a major prior to becoming a sophomore. And even some of them will change majors by the start of junior year. Enjoy high school and thoroughly enjoy college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A typical high school student is in class (not school but in a class) 25 hours per week. That student should be spending another 20 hours per week studying, doing home work and working on class projects. Whereas in college one will spend 15 hours per week in class and then 45+ hours per week studying, doing homework and working on class projects. Simple. And there are 168 hours in every week and slightly more than 52 weeks per year, so you should learn to manage your time well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t which of the eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League would allow you to do that, but I am certain that the best engineering university in the World allows that: MIT MIT Admissions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two ways: Be recruited by the head soccer coach of that college and use that as leverage to be admitted to that college and then to be on the soccer team Get admitted to the college on your own, and then contact the head soccer coach and ask for a chance to try-out with the team. Since soccer pre-season try-outs are in the late summer several weeks before college starts, you may not be able to do that, but you could try as a freshman in the Spring term to get a try-out and and then start playing for the team as a sophomore Go to the college’s athletic web site and review the rosters of the current soccer players and from their biographies determine how you compare to them before they were admitted to college. Then there is usually a link on the athletic web site for you to contact the head coach and describe your soccer prowess. Good luck. Here is an example of an athletic site for a D-1 college and a D-2 college, both in the Boston area: Class of 2020 - Boston University Athletics - Official Athletics Website https://bentleyfalcons.com/landing/index<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harvard explains it all here: Transfer Applicants You would be best to apply in January/February of your sophomore year. You will need an Unique reason for transferring and you will be in line behind any military veteran who took one to two years of course work while in the military before their honorable discharge. Indeed, you will need a Team to assist you and two members of that team will be your faculty adviser at your current college and also the head of the department at your current college. You will need Powerful forces to become one of the very few allowed to transfer into Harvard or any of the elite Private US colleges. The transfer admission rate is Less than one percent. Whip your team into shape. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No!!!!!!!!!! Forget the spectators. There are almost 12,000 athletes. Plus more than 12,000 coaches and staff and assistants. When the 1984 Olympics were held in Los Angeles, I was living within a reasonable walk of UCLA. The dorms were loaded with athletes. Those are the same dorms that have been emptied to protect the thousands of college undergraduate students. No. The Tokyo Summer Olympics (held in Tokyo) can not be held there with no spectators. HOWEVER a world wide Summer Olympics could be held in 2021 with no spectators if each event was held in a different location around the world……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have worked in the aerospace industry since 1978 and have worked with a wide variety of prime contractors in the USA and some in Europe. Most of the engineers I assist, have at least a masters degree and many have an Engineers Degree (like me) or a PhD. Therefore, it typically is anywhere from 5 years of post-high school college education to as many as ten years of college education ( I did nine). And even more important is the senior capstone project or thesis and your graduate school thesis and projects. If you wish to work for an aerospace company in anything but a low-level entry position, you will need project experience. And those that enter at that low level, will get a lot of project experience as they work in the industry. NOTE: the Aerospace industry has the highest percentage of engineers to total employees. It is engineering intensive. And one is continually learning throughout their career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Even if it is “stock part” an engineer has to determine the safety margin for that part. And, Every engineer who works for an aerospace company is an aerospace engineer Aeronautical & Astronautical Engineers Chemical Engineers Computer Engineers Electrical/Electronic Engineers Material Engineers Mechanical Engineers Industrial Engineers etc, Every single part of an aircraft, helicopter, cruise missile, rocket, missile, UAV, etc must be either designed or at a minimum assessed by one of the many engineers who work for that aerospace company. Enjoy your flight, it is typically very safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>High School? In our public school district that is a 4 month course in Spring term of 5th grade. Before the students head off to Middle School. It is too late by high school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merely check out the athletic web sites of the colleges you are interested in attending. On the web site will be the current rosters of the track team and the current times of the runners. If you are close to those times, then when you attend that college, you can try out for the team as a freshman. Simple Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the USA. You merely determine the public school district in which you and your family lives, and then attend the public high school for that district. Easy. Whereas, if you want to attend a public exam school like Boston Latin, then you need to study really, really, really hard for the rigorous entrance exam. And Boston Latin uses the same entrance exam as the private schools, so if you do well enough to be admitted to Boston Latin, you have an outside chance to be admitted to a good private boarding school. It is like trying to be admitted to UCLA (Boston Latin) versus Stanford (private boarding school). Analogous process. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. But really, in the middle of a Pandemic? Work something out with her or at least try really hard. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Grade 8? In grade 8 we had Safety Patrol, Student Government, Student Newspaper, Drame Club, History Club and several (many ) interscholastic sports. Any of those should give you an opportunity to shine for the Exeter admissions committee.

Good luck, and Exeter loves Football and Ice Hockey.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you attend a small liberal arts college like Amherst College or Williams College or their many peers, you will get an excellent education and a very good American college experience.

<|startoftext|>How much did you make in your short time working on campus? And if you had a campus job, most likely any expected Federal and State taxes were deducted from your pay checks.

Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Follow the guidelines here: New Resident - Welcome to Florida! - Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles If you have held your Austrian drivers license as an Adult (over the age of 18) for at least one year, you should be able to get a Florida drivers license by Proving residency in Florida Passing a vision test Passing written test of the Florida driving laws and regulations Welcome to the USA and enjoy living and driving in Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as I know you can use any approved car seat in a sedan or a convertible. Enjoy driving with your children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as you don’t mind cracking open your skull and bleeding on the concrete or asphalt, then go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If most of the colleges go online in the Fall of 2020 for undergraduate students, then as long as they are in a country in a convenient time zone related to the location of the college, then that should be easy. However, if they are required to enter the USA on a student-visa during the pandemic, then they most likely will not be approved for entry, given the current tone of the US government. Good luck for Fall 2020. Everything should be much better for Fall 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extracurricular activity? Only if you are volunteering to design web sites for Charities and spend a lot of face-to-face time in the process because meaningful extracurricular activities for admission involve team work and great inter-personal interactions. Enjoy your online time. Something you can do during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are basically two types of early admissions: Early Decision for which the applicant and their parents sign a Contract binding the applicant to attend if admitted. Early Action which means that the college (like MIT) will admit the applicant early (by mid-December) but the applicant does not have to accept the offer of admission and has until May 1st to decide. Either of those two early admissions process could totally Reject the applicant or defer the applicants application until the regular cycle for review. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As many times as you have the money and the time to waste. If you have not corrected the reasons your earlier visa applications were rejected then you are merely Giving money to the USA (thank you). However, if you have a very valid reason for a tourist or business related visa to the USA, then you will get one every time you apply, and enjoy your time in the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not if you are transferring Down. A friend of mine attended MIT for only the Fall term of freshman year, grew disillusioned for several reasons, and transferred to a college within Syracuse University easily to start Spring term freshman year. The college loved having him as a student and he then was valedictorian of his graduating class from college. Transferring down is Easy. Transferring Up or Laterally can be very difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing really. I had a room mate as a freshman in college (he was a junior) and that was great. After receiving my bachelors degree, I lived with room mates for ten years, all very pleasant. Then my (then) future wife and I lived together for seven years before getting married. Lots of different room mates, female and male, and we all got along very well. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way to do that, as a freshman, is to live at home with your parents or legal guardians. Therefore, you would either attend a local community college or be very lucky enough to be admitted to a good four-year college that is within a convenient drive or commute from where your parents live. If you are economically strapped, and can’t get much in the way of financial aid from the colleges, then Yes. Live at home for two years and attend a local community college and Pre-Plan (with your CC adviser) a path to automatically be admitted as a junior to your state’s top public university system. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a major global disaster destroyed the capability of most countries/regions to generate and provide electricity to their people, then we would return to the early 1800’s like environment and a hand written letter delivered by a postal worker would be it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. There are some four year colleges that will admit a person to be a freshman, but tell them they can not start at the college until the Spring term. Therefore, they will provide a list of general course requirements that most freshmen will take in the Fall term, and you can then attend a local community college to take those five courses. Win-win. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will finish your community college courses in December 2020. Therefore, apply in January thru February of 2021 to be a transfer student to a four year college, entering as a junior in the Fall of 2021. You can then use the intervening eight months to work in a job related to your major, gain some on-the-job experience and earn some money to pay for the last two years of your bachelors degree. Win-win-win. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And do what? If colleges are closed this Fall and students are only taught online, then there will still be a global lock-down. So instead of sitting at home and learning online, you are going to sit at home during this gap year and play video games online……. Of course, you could get a job at a hospital assisting in cleaning and prepping PPE equipment. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you need a lot of financial aid, then I would suggest MIT. Most other US colleges are either Need-Aware for international freshman applicants or provide little to no financial aid for international undergraduate students. Indeed the vast majority of colleges in the USA treat international Undergraduate students as Cash Cows. If you don’t need much financial aid, then look to WPI as well It is best to register for Free here, and use the search tool to assist you in finding US or Canadian colleges that meet your criteria: University & College Search Tool Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither. I did not attend my 25th reunion class at MIT for marching into and being part of the then current graduating class, because President Clinton was speaking. We would all have to arrive at least 4 hours in advance and pass through a very rigorous screening process to be admitted. Then you sit for over 4 hours with Nothing, until the graduation ceremony starts. I would not wish that on anyone. Keep Presidents away from any graduation ceremony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, if you are a good student, then that would be the top Public university in your state. They all have good engineering programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are about 2.3 million US students who start their freshman year in college each year. A full ride is: tuition, mandatory fees, room and board, books and supplies Every male NCAA D-1 student-athlete who plays tackle football or basketball Every female NCAA D-1 student-athlete who plays basketball, volleyball, tennis or gymnastics Most male or female NCAA D-1 student-athletes who play ice hockey Every freshman at an elite Private US college who along with all of their parents, fills out the FAFSA forms and the CSS Profile forms (each year) and the college determines from that information, that the student is economically poor and needs full financial aid Some freshmen at top Public universities in their state. If the public university thinks that the student has a good chance of being admitted to an elite private US college, then they may try to entice the student to stay in-state and raise the prestige of their university. There may be a couple of award winners who get a nearly full scholarship to college, but that is negligible I would venture that roughly one percent of the US college students are on a full-ride scholarship Therefore, be Poor and in the top 2% of your graduating class, or be a good student and one of the best in your state for your sport. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not: Entry Requirements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The college will still see that you took an AP course and received a Grade in that course from your teacher and your academic prowess will also be highlighted in any letters of recommendation that are submitted upon your behlf. The AP exam grade is ONLY used to offer you college credit once you are admitted to that college. However, many colleges, like MIT will allow you to take that course’s final exam in order to receive college credit, so the AP grade is moot. Simple and easy. Less worrying and more enjoying yourself this summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe, but as a referee, I spit as well. When you are running and sprinting for 90 minutes, there is a need to clear your throat/mouth, and there are no time outs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For 2019–2020 academic year? No. For 2020–21 if it is mainly online? No. You still need the professor and the material and it costs money to have the online instructions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Core curriculum? MIT speak calls it the General Institute Requirements: General Institute Requirements It is all listed there: Everyone takes: 2 terms Physics 2 terms Calculus 1 term Chemistry (I took Material Sciences) 1 term Biology (we didn’t have this in the 1970’s) 8 terms of Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) Laboratory and some restricted science/engineering courses depending on your major 8 “credits” of physical education (there are two PE sessions per term) and an intercollegiate sport counts towards the requirement Pass the swim test Or take two PE classes in swimming (I took the two classes as I loved the pool and the diving instructions, nothing like the 10 meter board….) No freshman has a major upon arriving at MIT. Everyone selects a major Prior to the start of sophomore year and some will switch their major at the start of junior year and still graduate on time. It is easy to minor in Business (management), Economics or Political Science since each of those is an HASS department and therefore one needs three in one-group and that also counts towards the minor. Then you have to check the requirements for each department/major. Figure on spending ~60 hours per week in class, lab, home work and studying. Excellent!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, there will much better sight-lines for the camera crews and there won’t be fans jumping up and waving to block the TV cameras. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I will salute by drinking a Corona…………………… beer…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Financial aid for International undergraduate students?????????????????????? Sure there are a “few” colleges (most of the elite Private US colleges) that will still provide up to and including full financial aid to all students, including international undergraduate students. However, the Vast Majority of US colleges, especially most if not all of the top Public colleges look at international undergraduate students as Cash Cows, who get Zero financial aid and pay for all of their bachelors degree education in Cash. Good luck, especially trying to get a F-1 student visa, although it should be OK by August 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have seen that from my area near Boston. You will need to be one of the best in your region/state as a high school basketball player. Playing on a state championship team will be a big help. Then get on a very good amateur team as sophomore and junior in the Spring. All the while, be in the top-third (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At 15 you are too young to volunteer with “Doctors Without Borders” and work in a Syrian refugee camp or a West African Ebola clinic, but maybe next summer. For now, call your physician and tell your doctor that you want to volunteer to assist during the pandemic. Your doctor can review your medical charts to see if you have any underlying conditions that may make that risky. Otherwise you have only (roughly) a 0.05% chance of dying from the virus (at age 15) and should be brought to the front line of the volunteers. You can assist in cleaning and prepping the PPE for the front-line staff, for example. Check with your doctor, and then also contact you local city or town hall. Every place needs assistance. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That there are no surprises. In high school and college when ever I had Physical Education class or played a sport, we all showered together afterwards. I referee college soccer and after our games, the team of referees goes to the locker room and we all change and shower together. I still play ice hockey throughout the Winter and after each session we all shower together in the same small shower with four nozzles and four players elbowing for space. No surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also play ice hockey (a lot). International soccer under the FIFA laws of the game, only allow 3 substitutions per game per team, total. No reentry if replaced by a substitute. And no time outs. Whereas in the NHL (for example), there are unlimited substitutions through out the game and each team gets one time out and there are Many “TV time outs” per game. Therefore, if a soccer player is “roughed up a bit”, they need to roll-around to get the referee to stop the game and bring in medical assistance. That is the way a soccer player gets a Time Out. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you need are wealthy and powerful parents. If they can afford over $80,000 USD per year for the total cost of sending you to a fine boarding school and they are Powerful, so that the school wants to be associated with your family: You are In. Just relax, do better in school, and thank your parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing wrong with majoring in music and then getting a masters in education and while you are writing songs you can be teaching music in middle schools or high schools. Nice!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh??? Most colleges Rightfully do Not allow pets (especially dogs) on campus. Period. I had a dog, that I got when I was 6 years old, he stayed at “home” with my parents when I went off to MIT. As it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no final decision yet on whether it is not looked at or not mandatory, and that is a big difference. So, if it is “Safe” to take the SAT, then take the exam. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming you are in high school or older, just ask your brother, he should be glad to assist you. Or, find someone else in your school or age group who is MTF and swap. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the summer of 2020 There are two ways to look at it: There will no vaccine available for COVID-19 therefore no groups should assemble and therefore there can be no summer camps this summer, There will be no vaccine for COVID-19 and the Death Rate for those aged 6 to 22 is about 0.05% which is the same as it was for measles prior to a vaccine being developed in 1963 and there were plenty of summer camps prior to 1963. Therefore, take all of the 6 to 22 year old people in the USA and send them, and them only to the many summer camps. The 19–22 year old adults will be in charge. They go (for free, funded by the US government) for 6 weeks. They all get and recover from the COVID-19 virus (minus the 0.05% who die) and then schools and colleges will all open in the Fall since 80% of the people at school or on campus will be immune and that provides herd-imunity. Take your pick…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question. The NCAA hierarchy has stated several times, if most of the students are Not on campus, then there will be No NCAA sports games. That will be on a league by league basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to say. I believe I have asked some interesting questions that also include web-links to authoritative sources, and………… Nothing. Most likely, it is a topic that only I am really interested in. So, it is possible that you have a certain insight into the Star Wars saga that others are not particularly interested in or knowledgeable about. Or maybe the question is too complex and that makes people think too much. It is best to not give up and to try other related (but maybe simpler) questions to generate response. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people would think of Michael Jordan when asked this question: 15 seasons and 6 NBA championships. But I think of Bill Russell - Wikipedia who played 13 seasons and won 11 NBA championships and before that he won two successive NCAA championships and a Olympic Gold Medal in basketball…. And as an Individual, one must consider Wilt Chamberlain - Wikipedia .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It used to be: Yes. That was because for many years one could only apply to one private college Early Decision (because it is a CONTRACT) and not any early action programs. However, now the colleges seem to be allowing One early decision plus several early action applications, but the Early Decision is a contract. And those colleges send lists of names (and home address and school name) around to the other private colleges. Just a means to check on your Ethics and Honesty. You would want to be ethical and honest, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. People with jobs in New York City, can, at the worst, get a “letter” from their employer stating that they need to be at their facility. Simple. Same across all US State borders. Where it will be interesting is at the borders with Mexico and Canada that many people used to cross every work day to get to their jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MIT does not have a journalism program nor a broadcast program. However, a number of students graduate from MIT in any number of majors and go on into journalism careers. Most of them worked on the MIT student newspaper (The Tech) The Tech I will assume, that by now, MIT also has a student “TV” station, and they certainly have a long standing radio station and students get valuable experience there. Therefore, continue your major and minor and get a “job” or volunteer at your college’s newspaper, radio station or TV station. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. However, to accept an offer of admission means you pay a $500 or Much more non-refundable deposit. Therefore, if you withdraw, you lose that deposit. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strict rule. If you did not major in Computer Science at MIT as an undergraduate you may not be admitted to a terminal Masters degree in CS at MIT. Indeed, the only ones who get a terminal masters in CS are those bachelors degree MIT students who did a stellar senior capstone project in CS and their p (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure if your 18 year old child enlists in the Army of Marine Corps. Then the child can back-pack for 36 months and get paid and get on-the-job training and get assistance with future college tuition. Win, win, win. Otherwise, who is paying for this 12 month adventure?????????? Not you nor not from the child’s college tuition savings……..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cash? No. You can sign the check over to her, and then she can Deposit the check into her bank account. Most banks will only allow the person to receive in cash (for a deposited check) a small percentage of the check, until the check clears and the bank has the money. I sign over checks to my wife from time-to-time and she to me. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are more NCAA D-3 student athletes than all of the D-1 and D-2 student athletes combined. NCAA D-3 athletes receive no (zero) money nor tuition assistance, NOTHING. We do it because we Love the sport, and in the big scheme of things it is Stress Relief. Being a student at an intense college like MIT, being a student athlete was a great way to have fun with friends (you will have Strong bonds with your team mates) and to relax and relieve stress. That is why I played intercollegiate soccer and ice hockey at MIT for the wonderful Team experience. I was asked to be on the rifle team, but I considered rifle somewhat stressful and instead won intramural titles in rifle and enjoyed shooting at the MIT rifle/pistol range for fun when score is not a concern……. Nothing like firing off 100 rounds of 0.22 ammo and the sound of the gun and smell of the burnt powder to relax when score is not important. (Intramural rifle was easy…..) Fun and stress relief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can do both. Work on your tennis and then become a “stunt double” for various movie and TV actors. Use that as leverage to break into the industry. Everyone needs leverage and tennis could be yours. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is part of the new NCAA rules which will be announced sometime in 2021 and start later in 2021 (Fall?) for the 2021–22 academic year. NCAA athletes will be allowed to be paid for the use of their image or for an endorsement. Hopefully (my opinion) that will involve an Escrow account that will be set-up to provide a limited amount of that money to the athlete while the athlete is still competing in NCAA sports and then full access after the person’s NCAA eligibility expires. Those athletes will be allowed to have an agent. I am hoping that will be a person who has to register with the NCAA, have an extensive background check by the local police and the FBI and then must follow NCAA rules for being an agent for a NCAA athlete. Simple. Stay tuned as no one will know for certain until Spring 2021 (roughly).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Post COVID-19???? That will be Fall of 2021, if we are lucky, when you will starting college as a freshman. Your entire gap year will be during the pandemic and you may as well volunteer to work at hospitals and medical facilities even if you only clean up. Either be a student (online most likely for Fall 2020) or work/volunteer to assist during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t. It is magic to organize, decorate and then be with that Special person as a date and with your friends. You just move forward with your life and don’t think back. And thank goodness that your family and friends are fine during this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting as a junior in high school at age 16, and continuing all the way through undergraduate college at MIT, I worked: During the high school academic year 14 hours per week and during the summer 40 hours per week at the local McDonald’s for slightly more than the current minimum wage During the academic year at MIT: 10 to 12 hours per week as a referee/umpire for intramural sports at 2 to 3 times the local minimum wage During the summers in college Junior engineer at the NY State DOT living at home Assembler and installer at an aluminum door/window/screen/awning company living at home Co-Op for 7 months (Feb-Aug of junior year) as a junior aerospace engineer at an aircraft company in Los Angeles Summer after bachelors degree before starting graduate work: Two jobs at MIT: mornings at the hypersonic wind tunnel and afternoons at the explosive test facility Then as a graduate student at MIT, everything was FREE: Free tuition and free fees and a generous stipend for living expenses. Additionally, I refereed high school and colleges sports for pay (twice minimum wage) Easy. Had all the money I needed to live and never needed a student loan. Just Do It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are allowed to arrive on or after 12:01 AM (beginning of the day) that your ticket or boarding pass states your flight will depart. Indeed, in the USA, the TSA lines do not open (in many airports) until 2 hours prior to the first flight scheduled to depart the gate. In Boston that is 5:30 am for the first scheduled flight (take-off at 6 am or later, so be prepared to sit in the plane in a queue) therefore the TSA line opens at either 3:30 am or 4 am (not too many rushing in at that time). There are some airports like Dallas-Fort Worth that have a hotel on the airport property and you can arrive days or weeks early and stay at the hotel, and then take the tram to the correct terminal and start the check-in process. NOTE: If your flight departs (for example) at 6 am and you enter the airport at 10 pm the night before and “hand out” on the ground-side of the TSA inspection area, many airports “won’t care”, but the local police may ask you some questions. NOTE: If you are on the air-side of the TSA inspection at 10 pm the day Before your flight (an example) (due to a flight cancellation and reschedule), you may get “tossed out” to have to pass through TSA the next day (day of your flight). It is highly recommended to enter the airport 2 hours prior to the gate-depart time of your flight. You never know what problems may occur at the TSA area or at the gate. Enjoy your flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From my experience in Massachusetts: “Is it hard to get on a girl’s soccer team in Middle School” As a Male? Yes. As a Female? No. Indeed, many schools carry more than one middle school team (for boys and for girls) because so many students sign-up. Most if not all Middle School (and freshman) teams are No-Cut. Therefore, if you sign-up And show-up to every practice and game/event (unless excused by the head coach), you are on the team. Enjoy the experience. And Males should have a boys team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the number of students on any one of those many campuses, and many would be commuting to the campus, it is probably better to go online for the Fall 2020. Indeed, I personally believe that Many colleges across the USA will be online for this Fall and that there will be No NCAA sports played this Fall. Without a vaccine, it is going to be very difficult to get large groups of people together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In most suburban settings, by the time the high school senior leaves home to attend college (end of the Summer) they should have at Least $5,000 in their savings account from summer jobs and savings over time. That is the absolute Minimum. Two summers at 10 weeks each summer at 40 hours per week at $10 per hour is $8,000……………………………….. So, there are No excuses. When I left home to attend college (1969) I had over 1,960 hours of work time at my job at McDonalds…… And had saved sufficient money to pay for my first complete Year of tuition at MIT. No excuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a soccer referee does: Warn, Caution, Dismiss Once she has been repeatedly warned, have her stuff moved to a Storage Center and tell her that you will pay for the first six months of storage and then the rest is up to her, or the storage center will dispose of her possessions. This is all assuming that you truly need that space in your home and your daughter is being stubborn. However, if keeping the stuff for another 6 to 12 months won’t terribly inconvenience you, then do the Nice thing Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have seen it in professional sports in the USA: soccer, NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, etc. If the game is “meaningless” in the standings at the end of the season or if it is late in a game that is essential won by one of the two teams, then yes, they will let that player have “a little more room” to play and excite the fans (some of whom are the younger professional players) in the player’s last game of their pro career. I remember when Doug Flutie was retiring from the NFL, it was late in the season and near the end of a meaningless game in the standings. The NE team “asked” the opposing team to “let up a little bit” on the last play of the game. Flutie as quarterback, took the snap and executed a perfect Drop Kick to score three points. That is an extremely rare play. Just an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t believe anyone can get a visa without a passport. A passport is issued by your country of citizenship. It is “proof” of who you are. However, one can enter another country with only a passport and no visa. But, I believe, everyone must have a passport to get a visa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow…………….. How quickly “we forget” The 1917 to 1918 and early 1919 flu pandemic killed at Least 50 MILLION people world wide. There was a Summer Olympics in 1920. There were professional sports with filled stadiums by 1920. Indeed, most people have Forgotten those 50+ Million deaths. Life will go on after COVID-19, albeit with fewer people worldwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really???? I thought a middle linebacker in tackle football was Supposed to have his “brains beat out”? And I know (from experience) that a goaltender in ice hockey or a goal keeper in soccer is merely a defender with their brains beat out. Been there done that. Indeed, I started doing more soccer and ice hockey After having suffered four concussions and the last was Major (unconscious for over 30 minutes). Work with Your doctor for Your medical condition. I did with mine and Many years later I am still playing ice hockey goaltender. And I take many pucks off the helmet……<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“trying to get my life together…” That sounds like a “situation”. Possibly the best move is for you to discuss this with your faculty adviser and the head of your department and negotiate a one-year Withdrawal from that college. That will give you plenty of time to “get your life together” and then you resume as a sophomore in the Fall of 2021…… Also you will get the pandemic behind you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Granted it was many years ago, but: A friend of mine in the Boston area was from Wales. While he was attending college in Wales, he played soccer for Manchester United and they paid for him to travel from his college to Manchester (or the away site) each weekend. He was an excellent substitute and the first to enter as a sub most times, scoring key goals or getting assists. However, first you need to convince a Premier League team that you have what it takes to play soccer at that level. But it can be, and has been done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. When I was the judicial committee chairman of my dorm, we had to deal with people like you. You won’t like the results. Wait until you get a single room (for sleeping). Indeed, you could get your Psychiatrist to write a letter to your college’s medical department requesting that the college provide you with a single bedroom and regular appointments with the college’s psychiatric department at the medical center. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you go to attend college, you will move out, like tens-of-thousands across the USA do every August. Until then, tell your mother you will be working a 40 hour per week job during the summer to save for college expenses and will assist in buying food for the family and in doing the types of work around the house that being a good room mate requires. Simple. Time to become an adult and not be a pest to your mother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me think this one through: As a Catholic Caucasian I was a minority in my MIT dormitory of the 12 students on my floor who all shared the bathroom and refrigerator etc. My room mate was an African American and there were two other African Americans of the twelve. There were two international students from Taiwan that lived and cooked next door (with various dead animals hanging on their wall). There were five Jewish students. So, I was the minority…… Everyone treated everyone else nicely and politely. The two males from Taiwan offered food to me from time to time…… And, of course, I was a freshman, and nine of the others were sophomores to seniors, so I was the young minority. And the Black Student Union used to hold meetings in my double dorm room, led by my room mate and I loved to attend and was welcomed. Why would a minority be treated differently anywhere that is well run?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously you have a Medical condition of some type. Prior to starting college (after you have been accepted and agree to enroll), most if not all US colleges require (mandatory) that you submit a detailed physical fitness report written by and signed by your medical doctor. In that report it should explain Why you are required to wear adult diapers. And the doctor should also make recommendations that your college should consider making to accommodate your physical limitations. If you can’t get your medical doctor to do all that (which is a requirement), you may want to think through attending college again, and instead attend a local community college and live with your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Loyola specifically states “recommended”, not mandatory: Requirements: Loyola University Chicago And your high school guidance counselor will send a mandatory cover-letter of recommendation along with your official transcript and that letter will describe you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole person. Sit down politely with your guidance counselor and discuss this. It will depend upon what your guidance counselor writes. I guess I attended high school when a “college track” demanded a Minimum of two years of a foreign language and almost everyone took three years and a number of us took four. There is a huge world out there……… Discuss this with your guidance counselor (and hopefully they don’t state “I told you so”….)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What, you Never attended a summer camp with 12 campers in six bunk-beds and a older counselor and all 13 are sleeping in One room? Shame on you and your family as that is part of the process of maturing from a child into an adult. You never had sleep-overs with cousins? Just Do It. It works out fine. That is what maturing is all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? I have known many families in which the parents are one religion and the children are another or even where the parents are of different religions. Therefore, everyone in the family could have different deep-set beliefs. That is each Individual’s right. And if you are an Adult, then you move out on your own and practice whatever beliefs you have (assuming they are legal for your local government). Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that is around 60% of US high school graduates who enroll as freshmen in college. Not everyone graduates from high school. Not everyone finishes a degree at college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The family gets to read the charter, and understand what the major points are for getting an education in that school. If you follow the guidelines of the charter you remain at the school and learn with your peers who are also obeying the charter. If you don’t follow the guidelines of the charter then you are remanded back to your local public school and have to tread water with the masses. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You get two points if you answer “One” However, you get ten points and full credit if you answer: SAT-1 is the basic general knowledge standardized test and the SAT-2 is a detailed standardized test for a specific subject: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology etc. Subject Areas Indeed, instead of calling them SAT-2 like they did in the “old days”, they are called SAT Subject tests now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because, like we did, we thought it was better for the enviroment. However, as an engineer, I had a chance to visit a business that provided cloth diaper service and saw the cleaning process that was required, and then with others determined that the overall cloth diaper usage requires more total energy than the disposable diaper industry. Three months into messy and horribly smelling cloth diapers we switched to disposable diapers and Never Looked Back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot of engineering related companies that have gone to nine days of work over a two-work-week time period. Therefore, everyone gets every second Friday off. Many people like that. However, when a project needs Overtime work, people are already working nine hour days (for eight of those nine days in a cycle) and therefore it is tougher to support a project crunch as a salaried professional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have a bachelors degree from a (hopefully) good college in Europe. My understanding is that the 3-year bachelor’s degrees focus on subjects related strictly to your major. If you have demonstrated through your last year capstone project or final thesis an ability to write well, and the US university departments believe in the quality of your college’s degrees, then you can easily be admitted to a masters degree or PhD program in the USA. It is possible that the US university may require you to take a couple of electives, or not, depending upon your ability to write well for technical papers in a STEM major. However, the college sports programs that are run primarily under the rules of the NCAA, have a “five year” clock. A person has, once they have completed high school, five years after they start taking college courses, to play four seasons of a college intercollegiate sport in the NCAA. Therefore, if you were to attend (for example) MIT as a masters student in engineering you would Not be allowed to play for the MIT varsity soccer team because it is more than 5 years after you first started taking college courses in Europe. However, under the NCAA rules, if there is a valid “reason”, then you and the Athletic Director of the US college can petition the NCAA for a waiver. I wouldn’t count on that unless you have a very valid reason. On the other hand, many US colleges and universities have a very strong community/club sports program. For example MIT has a very strong team in the local men’s amateur D-1 league and has won the league championship several times. And one does not even have to be a student at MIT to play on that team….. Therefore, separate attending college in the USA from playing a sport at a high level. In most colleges’ areas, there are very strong adult amateur competition at a high level. Many graduate students played on “my” MIT men’s amateur soccer team and ice hockey team when I was there. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A social watering hole for people with way too much time on their hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After completing your daily/weekly educational requirements: Explore the area and learn from the people and things around you. I did that for a month in England and one of our sons did that for six months in Australia. Learn from the different culture. Have a Great time!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is mid-May….. I believe you will be spending a long and very busy Summer at your college finishing your requirements. It happens every summer, so you are merely joining the long-line of those with poor time management. Good luck and enjoy the summer. I was supposed to finish my final thesis in May, but started a job at the end of August and finished the thesis during the first week of September. Of course, I did have a blast playing fast-pitch softball during those summer evenings……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A private university can “kick you out” for almost any reason. Whereas, you may have a little more due-process with a Public university in your state (as a citizen and as a tax-payer). Harassment is “they said and they said, and everyone else said…” So, it is highly doubtful that you have described the entire issue in that eleven word question. Time to find a Mediator and work things out, or if you have burned your bridges, time to find another university After you have settled everything with your current college’s bursar’s office. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you turn 21, you will lose your H4 visa status, and would be deported……. You may as well switch to F-1 student status while it is readily available to you. And you get OPT with that which allows you to work summers (off campus) in a paying job that is related to your major. Just Do It. F-1!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One needs to learn from history, and then focus on the present and the near future. The present is that you are an admitted student at UC Davis. Congratulations Go Mustangs!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I somehow doubt he chose Sacramento area over Providence because of “safety”. He may have told you that, but his real reason may be that he is considering becoming a Veterinarian and wishes to transfer majors to animal science then attend one of the best Veterinarian programs in the USA (UC Davis). On top of which, if he is a resident of California, he gets a nice reduced tuition in the UC system. Wish your son good-luck and support his decision. It is tough to work with animals (other than cats and dogs) in Manhattan…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you write a scientific or engineering or technical paper, you are required to show your knowledge of the prior work in that area and how your work compares to that work. And if you didn’t advance the previous work in that area, because you believe they were following the wrong path, then you need to show that and hopefully prove that. Referencing the history in your technical area is very important. That is why all STEM students at the great universities like MIT are required to learn how to write.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course. Personal hygiene should be taken care of at your home. One should not be cutting toe-nails at their desk, nor shaving their head in the company’s wash rooms. That is disgusting!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are a top student at Phillips Exeter or Andover (private boarding schools) or Boston Latin (public exam school) you are going to be considered a “bit higher” than the top students from the little public high school in Lake Placid village in way Upstate NY….. Yet I went to MIT with students from little out of the way high schools in upstate NY, indeed I was one of them. In general, it is the belief that the cream will rise, no matter where the milk is stored…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately no, because they are not considered Legal Refugees. They are “Deferred Action” illegal immigrants. However, there are all of those Public universities in all of the states. The public university could allow the DACA student to pay in-state tuition, and that is a big savings. Just the way it is.<|endoftext|>

You would share an apartment/house with others allowing you to split rent and cost of utilities. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy: If you are over the age of 18 and have completed high school tell them: Mom & Dad: Either assist me in going to a reasonable college Or I am moving out and enlisting in the US military.

Once a Legionnaire, always a Legionnaire: FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION RECRUITMENT Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Over the last several years, I believe over 100 small private colleges across the USA closed or were bought by another college or merged with another college. Several recently in the Boston area. Indeed many small (less than 1000 total students) private colleges were hanging on by their finger tips at the end of 2019. Now several will be gone with the pandemic. The number of US college students (undergraduate) is declining. Econ 101: Supply and Demand……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, your tires, when straight, should be no more than 12 inches from the curb. Second, when I park Down hill, then the front tire closest to the side of the road is turned toward the side of the road, so if the car rolls, for some reason, the front of the tire touches the side of the road which hopefully stops the car (obvious if there is a curb). If parking Up Hill, then I turn the tires away from the side of the road, so if the car rolls the rear of the nearest front tire will strike the side of the road. And lock your car and keep all valuables out of sight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is standard fare for car dealers. They will list a car in the newspaper advertisements or online, and in the small-print is a number. That is for a specific car on their lot, and yes they may have sold it between the time they posted the advertisement and the time you entered the dealership. One time, another salesperson was showing that car to another interested buyer when I walked into the dealership, and that other person bought it. I merely stated: “That is what I am interested in buying”, and they brought out their inventory of new cars that were in transit from the port to their dealership and I bought one of those. Simple. However, make certain you test drive a “similar” model to understand what you are buying sight-unseen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Projects Typically a senior capstone project or a senior year thesis. In lieu of that or in addition to that, then projects that the student did in summer jobs. For example, I worked a 7 month Co-Op job from Feb-Aug of my junior year and then had a senior capstone project and a senior aircraft design project. All three were important for my (then) near-future career.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To support level 4 and level 5 vehicles, one would put in a Lot of communication between the roadway and each car. In addition there will be communication between vehicles. That is the problem with Level 5 cars on the open road. There will Never be a time (before 2100) for which any regular public road system will be just for Level 5 vehicles. There may be a small subset and certainly private roads can be for Level 5 only. And in a Level 4 vehicle, there still must be a licensed driver who is Ultimately responsible for the safety and legal driving of that vehicle. It is Complicated……. And most car manufacturers do Not want Level 5. They want the Driver to be responsible for the vehicle and they want the owner to pay Lots of money for all of the fancy electronics……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A person on a F-1 student visa gets an OPT (optional practical training) period upon the completion of each degree. The OPT is 12 to 20+ months long, depending on the person’s major. Therefore, you graduate in May from college XXX and will start in late August at college YYY for a masters degree. You can get a job that summer (40 hours per week) and that would be part of your OPT for your bachelors degree. Eventually when you finish your Masters degree you would have an OPT period and if you then get a PhD (for example) you would have an additional OPT. OPT can be done in the summers between years (sophomore and junior for example). Therefore, you would direct your question to your first college’s DSO and your DSO would assist you in the transition. Simple and good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The USA needs more immigrants. Unless the average birth rate increases. Currently, there are more slots for college students in the USA, then there are college students attending. That imbalance used to be filled by colleges using International undergraduate students as Cash Cows. But with the terrible visa problems that is tapering off. So, either a whole bunch of small private colleges fold and close (or merge with more financially stable colleges) or more people need to want to attend college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League: Ivy League use the web site to see a list of the colleges and get web links and see the plethora of sports that they play. Then it is simple to Google: “Number of undergraduate students at XXX” Where XXX is one of those eight colleges. Take 25% of that number for the number of freshmen enrolled each year. Then note that the Yield of those colleges is around 75%. So take the sum of the eight freshman class sizes and divide by 0.75 . That gives you (roughly) the total number of applicants who were accepted. Of course a fair number were admitted to more than one of those eight and could only attend one. We will leave it for the student to work through the equations…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, now people are whining about cultural bias….. Back in the 1970’s people were whining that females were at a disadvantage for the questions…… Really??????????

<|startoftext|>Phillips Exeter or Andover….. It is like Harvard and Yale or Yale and Harvard. What if you lived three miles away from Harvard and decided to live at home instead of on campus? Same thing with Exeter. I hate to say this, but I will: Exeter is a Boarding School. They bring in day students to “look nice” to the local tax payers because Exeter does not pay any taxes and Exeter wants to minimize any complaints. Yes, you must be an excellent student……. BUT… you miss out on the 24x7 life and interaction with the other boarding students. Almost Half of the experience/education will be Living there 24x7. There are lots of positives of attending Exeter, and if you can, do so (and play ice hockey its a great sport…) But if you can eke out that extra $20K per year in any manner shape or form live there…….. I wouldn’t recommend an 18 year old student to attend Yale but live with their parents outside of New Haven…… Same with Exeter…. Even Rory lived on campus at Yale…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple: Develop a vaccine for COVID-19 Update: That was an initial and too flippant of an answer. At 15 or Any age, you should be doing what You love to do, and do all of that very well. At 15, you are who you are, and once you determine the majors (plural) that you may wish to pursue, you will be able to find several good colleges for You and your interests as both a student and as a whole person. Indeed, Half of an undergraduate’s education in college is maturing from a raw teenager into an adult along with all of the other peer students in that college’s undergraduate student Community. Indeed that is exactly why the elite Private US colleges all have a very Holistic process to select that undergraduate community. About 75% of the admissions process to an elite college is being a Person (not student but person) who is an excellent fit with that college’s typical peer community and offers that community a lot Outside of the classroom or the laboratory. Be the person you are, and be a very good and interesting and interactive person and you will do just fine. And 80+ of the leading US colleges wrote a report telling people what they want from a successful freshman applicant: Read the article, the links and the report: Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions Of course, a COVID-19 vaccine or medicine would be nice in your spare time as well…… Good luck!!!<|endoftext|>

I recommend at least 10% of your gross salary. And one should Never tap into their 401K to pay for their children’s college education. Period. And neither the Federal, state, local governments nor the colleges believe you should tap into your 401K. Therefore, the children’s college education comes After: 401K contributions Paying for your home and living expenses Simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Personally, I doubt it. Most educational institutions in the USA treat international students as Cash Cows. Since Phillips Exeter Academy guarantees financial aid for all who are admitted, they will provide financial aid to international students, but I am certain they will balance goodness of student/person versus affordability for an international student application. However, since you believe you are among the best of the best, and since you know that a place like Exeter places a huge emphasis on physical fitness and sports participation in each of the three sports seasons per year, if you fit the Exeter mold, then apply. It is 100% guaranteed to not be admitted if you do not apply. Trust your gut-feeling: If you believe that Exeter is perfect for you and you for Exeter, then Apply. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, let’s think this through: First, to be able to apply for a F-1 student visa, you must have been admitted to an US college and the college has supplied you with a letter of acceptance and an I-20 form. Therefore, your “mental disorder” did not prevent you from being admitted. Then you will schedule an interview with an US consulate staff member who will do a cursory background check on you in your country prior to the interview: Do you have a criminal record in your country due to your mental illness? Has your country or any other country placed you on a “Do Not Fly” list due to your mental illness? Finally, during the interview do you plan on having a mental breakdown? If you answered No to all of those questions, then you should be good to be Considered for a F-1 student visa. There are many other hurdles you must jump in that process. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I would assume: One’s own country. In your own country you minimize travel and all of the issues with student visas.

<|startoftext|>First, I am really glad that you realize that it is The Ivy Athletic League and that eight colleges in the Northeast of the USA, that are all within a bus ride of each other, form that NCAA D-1 athletic league, and that those colleges play the most sports of any college in the USA. Indeed over 16% of the undergraduate students of those colleges will play an intercollegiate sport at the highest level. The overall admission rate for those eight colleges is less than 10% and since most if not all of the elite private US colleges have a self-imposed quota on international undergraduate students, the admission rate for international freshman applicants is around 3% across those eight colleges. However, if you are a recruited athlete who is a very good student, then the admission rate is over 80%. Check out Ivy League for the sports that they play and for direct links to the colleges and the colleges’ athletic teams’ web sites, where you can see if you could be recruited for a sport. Additionally, if admitted to one of those eight colleges, they Guarantee to charge you only what they believe you and your parents can afford to pay, after you and all of your parents fill out the daunting CSS Profile forms each year, which are then verified by an independent agency in your country that is trusted by the colleges. That includes getting a Free college education. However, five of those colleges will hold asking for any financial aid (as an international applicant) against you during the admission process and if you are not a recruited athlete then the admission rate for you would be closer to 1%. Yet, Harvard, Princeton and Yale are all Need-Blind, and will admit you with No influence if you ask for financial aid.

<|startoftext|>Yes, when we were moving from Los Angeles back to Boston we took a nice drive across country. After the movers left with our furnishings, we drove a short distance to Indigo, CA and spent the night to avoid LA commuter traffic the next morning. Then we drove 640 miles to Las Cruces, NM the next day. There was really nothing we wanted to see between those two, and we stopped for lunch in Tucson. When you are driving across the USA there are several places where one would want to drive more than 500 miles in one day to get by the stuff you don’t want to see to spend more time where you want to be vacationing. Las Cruces was merely a convenient stop before we headed to Carlsbad Caverns for a great day and evening.<|endoftext|>

Please, when you go away to college it will be 24x7 on your Own. However, when the admission is rescinded, you can remain at home and attend a local community college. Good luck…… Update: Was what I said harsh? Yes, it was supposed to be. “top-tier college”, expects the best of the best, and 70% of college is learning on your own, using the resources around the person, including professors, peers, online resources, books, etc. A person has to be able to function well independently.

<|startoftext|>Toddlers are between the ages of one and three years old. I graduated high school in 1969. My mom was a stay-at-home mother that was very typical of the 1950’s. There were soap operas and game shows on TV during the day and if she stopped to watch, I would watch as well. There was lots of screen time in the 1950’s mixed in with everything else.

<|startoftext|>It is May, and I assume you are now finishing your junior year in high school, and are a rising senior for this Fall (in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic) and are uncertain about attending college. You could apply to some colleges this Fall, but then you don’t have to accept an offer in April 2021. If you don’t accept an offer or don’t get any, then you don’t really have a useful gap year, as that following September you would start all over applying to colleges, and why would your Former high school guidance counselor or former teachers give you the “time of day” when you ask for their support to apply to colleges, when they will be loaded down with current seniors who wish to apply to colleges. So, apply this Fall (2020) to start college in 2021, and if you don’t like the though of college come April 2021, then enlist in the military and get some on-the-job training, and later assistance to pursue whatever college education you wish, after experiencing different jobs.

<|startoftext|>Wow, that is weird. Our sons graduated high school in 2009 and 2010, and we readily determined that they needed access to one of our phones when they were freshmen in high school.

When they graduated college, they got their own cell phone plan and their own cell phones. Easy.

<|startoftext|>I believe that one should first find the colleges that are a great fit for that individual, including majors (plural), setting, type of peer students, etc. etc. etc. Then, when the admissions’ acceptance offers arrive with their financial aid forms, it is OK, to start college as a freshman, Planning on borrowing only $27K total over the four years it takes to earn the bachelors degree and all of that is borrowed from the Federal direct loan program. One should be able to start a job after graduating from college with a starting salary of $54K or greater and then it will take an easy five years as a single person to pay back that modest student loan. If you think you will make Less than $54K per year as a starting salary for You at that college and in that major, then only plan on borrowing Half of that starting salary. If you do that you will be fine and can attend any college that meets that cost-effectiveness criteria. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our sons (who graduated high school in 2009 and 2010) never needed a credit card while in high school. Ever. No child does. None. However, as soon as they were seniors in high school, to get them used to the process, I gave each of them an American Express Card that was tied directly to my account and for which (with a few clicks of the web browser) I could change their spending limit or approve a purchase above a maximum I had set. They each carried that card with them senior year and then through four years of college as an emergency and only one of them needed to use it once. Go to American Express and get a card for yourself, and then you can give associate cards to your children and your spouse…. And you control everything. Then when they went to college, they got a bank account near their campus and I was a co-owner of the account. They got (at age 18) their own credit card with that account, but I could monitor the spending via the internet. That lasted through college. I highly recommend that path: AMEX for an emergency card Their own card at a bank close to their college campus starting as freshmen Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our sons graduated from college in 2013 and 2014. Both were required to move off-campus as seniors (the colleges only guaranteed/provided 3 years of on-campus housing) so they got together with 2 to 3 close friends (also college students) and rented an apartment or house near the campus. In both cases, the landlords Required a co-signer. I knew all of the boys, and gladly co-signed for each of my sons (for the Entire rental unit). Never had an issue as I also knew their parents and knew that no one had any financial issues. Co-signing made sense to me, to assist the boys, and it truly helped our sons. So, it depends on the circumstances. However, once they graduated from college they each got jobs with a very good annual salary and therefore did not need a co-signer in order to rent an apartment. So, help them launch that first year or two and then Let them fly on their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, the NCAA sets a hard and fast Clock, that starts ticking the moment you start taking college classes After having left high school.

So, if you started college directly after leaving high school, graduated in four years, never having played a NCAA sport, and started graduate school at the same or another college, Yes, that person would have One season of any of the NCAA sports. The graduate student could play a Fall sport, a Winter sport and a Spring sport, all for one season each. However, given that the graduate student is an amateur at the sport, and hasn’t played at the NCAA D-1 level in many years, why would any NCAA D-1 college give that person a one-year athletic scholarship????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our sons got their first credit cards when they entered college and obtained a bank account near their college’s campus. They received a savings account, a checking account and a credit card. They received No checks and were expected to use the ATM for cash or ETF to pay bills or use their credit card and then pay the statement each month. I was a joint owner for the four years they were college (graduating in 2013 and 2014) and could check on their financial status. That was sufficiently early for them to gain experience in using a credit card, and in the USA, it is nearly impossible to get a credit card under the age of 18, and they were both 18 years old when they got their first credit cards. I recommend that path, with parental “assistance/overview” for the first several years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless you are truly enamored with Manhattan (and relatively wealthy to live there), I would focus on the other two colleges.

<|startoftext|>I am sorry, but in most schools that I know, you won’t be able to as a junior in high school. First, in every high school that I know, the interscholastic soccer program is over-subscribed. Therefore, there are No juniors on the JV team who aren’t (at that time) a clear candidate to be a valuable player the following year on the Varsity team. The coaching staff does not want to waste valuable time working with a junior rookie who may have no chance of assisting the varsity team. Instead, see if your school has an intramural soccer program or if your town has a youth soccer program for people of all abilities. Then, after a few years, you may be able to play high level intramural soccer in college or in a local adult amateur league. I am just trying to be realistic, based upon what my long experience has been with high school, youth, college and adult amateur soccer. If you are a really good runner, then try-out for the high school cross-country or track teams. They will work with anyone who tries and there are no cuts in cross-country or track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I believe so. Renters insurance covers your belongings. The cost will be based upon the amount of “stuff” and its value that you are insuring and the area in which that stuff will be (where you are renting).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? To get money from the government you would need to meet the government’s criteria for a school. If you get together with a group and create a public Charter school then the school will get money from the state. But no individual who is doing home schooling should ever get any money from the state, directly. You may be qualified to have your home-schooled child access some state functions/places for free or low cost to assist in the home schooling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are studying to become a Mechanical Engineer. Here is a definition of Astrophysics (and also go to the NASA link that is embedded): What is Astrophysics? I don’t see a real link with Mechanical Engineering. Unless you are working at JPL (NASA) building instruments to be sent into space by NASA to make measurements to assist Astrophysicists. But then you would still be a Mechanical Engineer. AI is a broad term and you might want to do your graduate work in a department that is doing a lot of Mechatronics. Then you would be building smart mechanisms to do practical things, possibly even being sent to the Moon or Mars or an Asteroid to gather data to support the research of Astrophysicists. Have some long and polite and professional discussions with your junior year professors and see what they think, based upon your interests and skills. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe just full military power. They are landing and should have a low amount of fuel and therefore will be towards the low end of the weight spectrum for operation.

<|startoftext|>Be frugal and practical. We got married at age 38. We put on our own small wedding. We limited it to 40 (total) guests, like a large holiday party…. We looked around and enjoyed being wined and dined by various venues trying to get our business. We must have had three full (free) diners with the final venue, a wonderful high-end hotel in Harvard Square (Charles Hotel) owned by a MIT graduate (loved that….) The Charles Hotel as we planned the final details. There we had three rooms/areas reserved. We had the pre-wedding in one room, the wedding in a large open area of the hotel with wonderful views out of the windows, and dinner/dancing in the third room. A close friend was also a minister and he married us. And we “lucked out”. We were getting married on Saturday, and that prior Wednesday Iraq invaded Kuwait…… By Thursday morning a Saudi Prince who had been staying at the hotel took over Three floors of the hotel as a Saudi command center in the USA (for twelve months), and that included the wedding room we had booked….. For no additional cost we were given the Presidential suite for Friday and Saturday nights. It was so big that my wife and all of her sisters and lady friends had their sleep-over party there Friday night…… A few more than 40 showed up, and the hotel did not even blink nor charge us any more and they threw in a great eye-opener breakfast on Sunday morning. For music we spent weeks looking at groups “playing in the Boston parks and on the Commons” and found one we liked and got a Great price and they were Wonderful!!! Make the wedding Your Adventure and enjoy the several month planning process (and all of the free meals you get from the venues you visit…) Great!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cloth diapers………………………………………………. We tried that for four months with our first child (1991). Oh what Pain and Smell that was. We had a diaper service and you saved the dirty diapers (even if you were on a multi-day family trip) and had the service pick them up and clean them. The alternative was doing a Gross hot water laundry each day. And, there have been studies that show that the proper treatment of cloth diapers compared to disposable diapers can use More total energy than just using disposable diapers. I actually discussed the issue with agencies of the Federal government to see if there could be special collections of disposable diapers and then taken to a factory where, with the proper mixture of chemicals and other materials, they could be turned into road building materials or car-crash-cushions along the highway. Still being evaluated….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t borrow money for a financial cushion, get a “line of credit”. That line of credit could be a close family member who would help you in a pinch, as long as that pinch is not too big. And once you start your career, you should keep track of all expenses, everything that you pay for (everything) for a complete Year. Then divide that by four, and that is the Minimum cash cushion in a Savings account you should have, and gradually double that (half of a year’s total expenses in cash in a Savings account, not a checking account). Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Over the years, I have always had the option to work at home occasionally. Indeed, prior to the lock down I was working from home two days per week because it was convenient for me and did not inconvenience my company.

If that can be done from home a few days per week, then fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Primarily because they negotiated and Signed a contract with USSF for how they are paid. And the men negotiated and signed a different contract. The women make little money as “professionals” in league play, while the men make a lot of money in the separate league play, so the different contracts were actually good for each of them. And the Prize money that FIFA awards for teams that do well in the World Cup is MUCH MORE for men than women, because FIFA MAKES MORE MONEY on the men’s World Cup than on the women’s World Cup. Indeed, in 2015 FIFA had to Beg countries to host the women’s world cup because it is generally a money Loser for the host country. The US women are doing just fine overall for pay. All of this is merely more free publicity so that they can make more money in their league play…….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not really. An international student leaves their country to study elsewhere because they believe that other country is far better for them. However, India has many excellent colleges and English is the nominal language or should be. So why is there any problem with the IELTS or TOEFL test???? And colleges in Canada or the USA are Expensive. So you have to have money. There are No colleges that I am aware of in Canada that are free or nearly free for an international student, because all of the very good Canadian colleges are Public colleges and need to charge more for an international student to appease the Canadian tax payers who support the colleges. Whereas in the USA, there are a number of Private colleges that will offer up to and including Full financial aid for an Excellent international student. Sign up for free at University & College Search Tool and explore the various colleges in the USA and in Canada that are cost-Effective for you. And if TOEFL or IELTS exam is difficult for you, then you will not be able to study outside India and it is not clear to me that you could be an effective student in India, as English should be the standard language for learning, at least the British version of English. Indeed, try for colleges in England as you may be able to get a discount coming from India. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same way any high school sophomore/junior/senior decides on a college: Determine what You want in a college: Majors (note that it is Plural) Location Climate Size Types of peer-students Activities on campus Activities in the area etc. Then you try to visit the campus Before applying if you can do so cost-effectively. However, before accepting an admission you should, if at all possible, visit the campus for Three days and two nights. Stanford is a Reach college for everyone who applies. Check with your teachers and guidance counselor to get an indication if Stanford could be within your reach. Then apply to Stanford and at least six other colleges, all of which are a very good fit for you, some reach, some could-get-into, and some should-get-into. Then come April you will have a few acceptances and can make the most cost-Effective choice for You. Simple, but requires Work on your part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>College is Not your only path to career success. After high school (diploma or GED), there are three paths to a successful career: College for those who need an associates degree, bachelors degree or higher to pursue a specific career. For me that was aeronautical and astronautical engineering and two graduate degrees, Apprenticeship: There are many careers for which you merely apprentice with an expert in that area and then you eventually become more skilled and become an expert: Cooking/chef, art, dance, music, singing, construction, plumbing, electrician, carpenter, barber, beautician, etc. etc. etc. etc. However, for some of those you may need a certificate, which you may be able to get at a local community college Enlist in the military and get on-the-job training in many areas, a great career and assistance in getting a certificate or a college degree if needed later in life Three ways to move forward with your life. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The average college student, in a college that requires 120 credits for a bachelors degree takes 15 credits per term. Therefore, if you take 18 credits per term, then you can do that in three terms. Some colleges have a Winter term (in January) and they will allow you to take 6 credits during January, and then another six credits in the summer. Therefore, if you take 18 credits first term, then 6 in the Winter one-month term, then 18 in the Spring term and then 6 in the Summer term, you can get 48 credits within one calendar year. And that is intense, but for one year is doable.<|endoftext|>

If you come to school dressed distinctly differently, then your first month to a year could be a disaster. Humans, especially the children, are pack animals. If you look or act differently than the pack, you will be harassed until you prove yourself. Blend in at first, find your own “pack” of peers and activities, and you will be Fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really??????????? I graduated high school in 1969….. In elementary school if you Sassed a teacher, you got Slapped or Hit across the hand with a Strap or Paddled by the Principal. And in junior high school and senior high school you were in detention for at least a week: first time a mandatory one hour study hall after school and you missed all after-school activities. Second time was assisting the janitors in cleaning the building and the third time (ever) was cleaning the toilets for a week……………… One did Not sass. One had Respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my personal opinion: No. However, they could if all of them were exposed to the COVID-19 virus. In the 5 to 22 year old age bracket the death rate of the virus is about 0.1 percent which is what the death rate for measles was before there was a vaccine, and for Many Many years students attended school, got the measles, sat-out two weeks at home working on assignments, and then returned to school with nearly permanent immunity. So, all of the 5 to 22 year old students should head to 5 week summer camps in mid-July with the 18 to 22 year old students as counselors. Hopefully by the end of the 5 weeks they have all recovered and are immune and head back to school. Since 85% of the people in a school are the students, that will provide herd immunity for the 15% who are the adult staff. Simple. Worked for many hundreds of years. Otherwise, it may not be safe until September 2021…….. And most may get the virus anyways…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is only for a Bachelors degree. I firmly believe that you must do a self-evaluation: How much can You make in an annual starting salary in that career, having majored in that department of that college? Then with those answers for the various colleges you are considering: Try (as a high school senior deciding) to plan on either borrowing Half of that annual starting salary over four years or $27,000 over 4 years which you get from the Federal student loan program While in college going into 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years (and graduate on time….) keep the total amount borrowed (due to changes of various types) to Less than 100% of the annual expected starting salary Anything greater than that is too much, and find another college.<|endoftext|>

Actually, it was quite safe being a public school teacher when I graduated from high school in 1969: Everyone feared the teachers, including the 70 year old 5 foot tall female junior high school teachers. They breathed fire like dragons and could scorch any miscreant. Today, I am not so certain, however our sons graduated high school in 2009 and 2010 and I never heard anyone talking about the physical risk to the teachers in our public school system. Granted both of those were in the Suburbs. In the inner city, like in the Bronx or Queens, from the time you got out of your car to the time you almost made it to the door of the school before being shot-at with a zip-gun….. At least the home-made zip guns were far far far less accurate than the Japanese rifles…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here is my recollection, and I graduated high school in 1969. Prior to Title IX being passed in the USA (circa 1972) female sports were horribly downplayed. While things like Field Hockey and Team Handball may have been popular in Europe and other parts of the world, they were essentially non-existent in the basic fabric of US sports. Then, somewhere along the line, the “powers that be” decided that girls in high school should have a sport while the Boys are playing are Real Sport: Tackle Football. But girls were supposed to be “lady-like” and not really sweat (true story) and it seemed that the physical education department Made Up this sport called “Field Hockey” so the girls could trot around on the field wearing skirts, not running too hard for fear of sweating, and the referees would blow their whistle every few seconds for some weird penalty and the game would stagger along at a boring pace until someone was declared a winner. It moved to college in a similar fashion. In the early 1980’s I was refereeing a D-3 college women’s soccer game, and on a near-by field was a college women’s field hockey game. A friend of mine was watching and counted the number of whistles on the field hockey game between each of my whistles during the soccer game. He calculated that on average there were 27 whistles in the field hockey game between each two of my whistles for fouls/etc. in the soccer game…….. Of course, in 1984, I was at the Los Angeles Summer Olympics and saw two Men’s field hockey games. What Brutality!!! What Skill Level!!! What excitement!!!! However, it was too late to salvage in the USA. With Title IX being balanced with girls playing field hockey and boys playing tackle football, no high school nor college could afford to allow Real field hockey to be played by the males…… So, because the game was “Bastardized” in the USA to accommodate females before Title IX, and then with Title IX, there is no way that boys can play in high school or men in college. If you want real male field hockey you have to find a club, just like with Cricket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want to be part of the MASS Transfer program: Campus Directory read everything there and at your college’s web site where you will find this PDF document: https://www.hcc.edu/Documents/Courses-Programs/Transfer/umassamherst.pdf You will see if you have a 3.4 or 3.5 GPA from HCC you can enter directly into UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College as a junior. I “believe” if you have at least a 2.6 GPA you can become a junior at an UMass campus, but not necessarily at UMass Amherst. However, you need to speak with your faculty counselor at HCC, after reading everything at those two web sites I noted, above. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have good start. Get on the freshman team (there should be No cuts for those who come to every practice and try) and work with the coaching staff to find your best position for their Team. Remember, it is a team sport. You may be a better receiver, but the coaches may need you on defense for pass protection….. Also the freshman team will follow the lead of the head varsity coach and work similar plays so that as a sophomore you have a chance to move directly to varsity. However, remember it is far better to be a starter on the JV team than a bench sitter on the Varsity as a sophomore. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, as a fully-funded graduate student at MIT we roughly had that. We had free tuition plus a generous stipend towards living expenses.

<|startoftext|>For me, it was when I felt I had a great basis for a productive and enjoyable career. I got my bachelors degree at MIT and then was asked to stay and perform research and get graduate degrees at MIT in aero-astro. I had the option of Masters-PhD or the Masters-Engineers degree and chose the latter because it had a much broader course requirement and was more oriented towards running large projects. (I had to take several courses in each of five areas of Aero-Astro and participate in a large team project (designing a space colony for NASA) plus a totally unrelated large project thesis. That was sufficient for my career, but I continue to learn every week or day related to engineering, refereeing soccer and life in general. But college? There was no need for me to get a MBA because I was more interested in engineering project management and not the business project management. That is why my final degree: Engineer of Aeronautics & Astronautics was perfect. Two of my friends did that, and then also revisited their thesis and then got a PhD. One became a professor at MIT and the other a senior vice-president at Orbital Sciences developing new rocket launches. However, many more of us were satisfied with the Masters and then the Engineers degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have worked with two gentlemen from India who received their PhD degrees from US universities, went to work in industry (OPT) and then the company supported them to receive permanent residency in the USA.

However, what isn’t known is: does someone who submits a high SAT/ACT score to a test optional university gain some advantage? That is not known and would be case by case. I believe that the SAT is being offered around mid-September 2020. With people social distancing and any summer activities curtailed due to the pandemic, there may be time to prepare for the SAT test. But if you do spend some time doing that, make it Fun time in some manner. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

And yes, you would, Your parents live together in a state, and you are attending a Public school in another state, because another person has been officially designated as your legal guardian. For example, your parents live in California and you are living with your grandparents (who are your legal guardians) in Boston and attending the public Boston Latin high school. In that case, then you will Not receive in-state tuition at UCLA but you would at UMass Amherst (as an example) Simple and common sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>AP classes are Only to gain advanced credit when you are enrolled in a college. Therefore, AP classes should Only be offered senior year of high school and “possibly” for a few advanced juniors. AP classes are way too hyped. There are many ways to challenge yourself: Honors classes Dual enrollment Extra projects AP classes. Not necessarily in that order, but most of the people that I personally know (including our local high school) place AP classes near or at the bottom. Too much “teaching to the test” and not enough real learning. Relax, less worrying, enjoy high school and you will do fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will assume that a family friend is going to loan you money to assist in paying for medical school. If you don’t have the money yet, and there is no signed contract for the loan, then there is no loan. Have your family friend loan you the money in April of your 3rd year of the 4 year medical school program. By that point, you already have all of the financial aid that you can get for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years, and have filed for financial aid for the 4th year without yet having that loan. Then use the loan to assist in any extra expenses for the 3rd and 4th years. The key is Not to initiate the loan too early or it will work Against you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over exposure. In a typical, non-pandemic year, there is Major League baseball for 162 games per team (each on TV) from late March into October. Additionally, there are almost 160 minor league baseball teams scattered across the USA. For example in Albuquerque, I could watch U New Mexico baseball or a very good minor league team, directly across the street……. Whereas, from September through December, every Saturday is college football and every Sunday is NFL football, and there are No real minor leagues in tackle football. Those are the reasons. Enjoy your college and pro (and high school) sports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the USA. I have been involved with interviewing many people for engineering related jobs. I can think of No time that I or anyone in the interview process ever asked an applicant about their health. Almost every job offer has a probationary period. And I have never interviewed someone to work with hazardous material or in a hazardous job. And all interviews are in-person or via Skype (face-to-face). All of our facilities meet the requirements for the full movement of anyone with a disability, and I have worked with people who are blind or deaf. About the only thing we will ask, is: Is there any reason that you won’t be able to work for us in the next 6 to 12 months? That would be the time for someone to tell us: I have a one month vacation planned to XXX And we would explain the vacation policy and how we could accommodate that I have a surgery scheduled for YYY and that will require a month of rehabilitation…. Been there, no big deal. We work with the employee However, the person hired Knows (signed contract) that either the first 6 or 12 months is probationary and they can be let-go for Any reason. I can imagine if someone is continually calling-in sick and missing lots of work time over and over again with no signs of let-up, that we might trigger that clause and terminate the person, but I have never seen that happen. Everyone I have ever assisted in hiring has always Loved the career they are in and looking forward to working with us. So, once again, I would never ask about someone’s health nor would any of my colleagues. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. You will need to get a F-1 student visa for your college studies and at the same time you will assist your wife in applying for a F-2 visa (spouse of a F-1 visa holder): follow links Students and Exchange Visitors and useful info: Bringing Dependents to the United States Remember, in order to get that F-1 visa for you and the F-2 visa for your wife, you will need to Convince the US consulate staff member who interviews you that: You and your spouse have sufficient money to pay for everything listed on your I-20 form that you received from the college you will attend, and that the two of you will Not require your wife to work in the USA to make money for you to live in the USA That you and your wife will immediately leave the USA after your PhD studies are completed and you have completed any OPT related to your PhD degree That you have strong ties to your country of citizenship That you are both “good people”….

<|startoftext|>For what? Both are part of the great University of Massachusetts system. And, just like with the great University of California system (across the board), I would recommend UCLA and UC Berkeley in that order, and all of the others based upon individual fit and needs, the same with the UMass System. I would always recommend UMass Amherst first (in most cases). However, among UMass Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell, I would ask you to check your specific needs and desires. If you live in or close to the city of Boston, then UMass Boston is an excellent choice. If you are moving to Massachusetts to study, then I would recommend UMass Dartmouth or Lowell, depending upon your major. For many years UMass Boston was a commuter school for local residents and while it is building some dormitories, I believe it still has that “commuter” feeling, which is Wonderful for a local student who wants to save money. So, check them both out, and find the one that is the best match for You. And both UMass Boston and Dartmouth play NCAA D-3 sports so you should find an opportunity at either campus. (Whereas Amherst and Lowell are NCAA D-1)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Only the coaches who Bring In more MONEY than the college presidents do. Indeed, around the country, there are many college presidents who bring a Ton of Money into the college and make more than all of the coaches (combined) at that college.

And that goes back to the cavemen days when those who assisted with the Hunt got a piece of the meat……..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The specifically states “…High School Juniors…” So what is the issue? Are high school juniors typically graduating in June 2020 and therefore trying to attend college in Fall 2020????? And since this is the end of April or beginning of May, all the applications for the Fall of 2020 are Over. This is for current high school juniors who will be Seniors in the Fall of 2020 and will be applying before January 1st, 2021 to be college students in the Fall of 2021. My personal opinion is that Harvard believes that a Harvard applicant should know that. However, in these uncertain times, since nothing is certain, it is good to ask for a clarification. Good luck in the college application process this Fall or if you are a senior, then best of luck in college this Fall. And if you are a high school sophomore who will be a junior this Fall, then you have a Whole year to worry about this, so merely settle back, enjoy whatever high school experience you will have in the Fall of 2020, with the knowledge that by Fall of 2021 there should be a vaccine and things will be (almost) back to normal…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the world of total uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hang in there. You may not need a F-1 student visa to start, because many colleges may opt for on-line studies for the Fall or if they bring in the US students, they may still encourage the international students to remain in their country and attend the Fall semester virtually (online). That is the beauty of uncertain times….. Nothing is certain…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, every high school age person, once they are 16 years old, should have a paying Summer Job. Period. Second: I graduated high school in 1969 and over 2/3rds of the seniors had part-time jobs during the academic school year (for which we needed to get a work permit from the School District with approval of our parents). Working at fast-food restaurants (I worked 14 hours per week at McDonald’s during the school year), gasoline stations, grocery stores, etc. etc. etc. Many of the businesses that dealt with the public had high school students working part-time jobs there (including banks). However, by the time our sons attended high school (graduating in 2009 and 2010) the number of students having part-time jobs during the school year was less than 20%. Mainly because, many of the jobs that I and my peers had part-time as teenagers were now full-time jobs for many adults….. Additionally, there were Many more sports and school activities for the teenagers, and we encouraged our sons to participate in actiivities. Additionally, from junior year through to the start of college (MIT) in 1969, I worked roughly 1900 hours at that McDonald’s and earned over $2,300 in pay. And the tuition for my first Complete year at MIT was $2,150…. Therefore part-time jobs in the 1960’s were a Huge part of paying for college and almost no one had a significant student loan. Where as in 2009 working 1,900 hours at those types of jobs would earn the student maybe $19,000 and a full year’s tuition at those colleges was now over $45,000 per year…. Sad commentary, but true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, the lock down due to COVID-19 occurred After all of the seniors had submitted their applications to the various college for both admission and financial aid. And the lock down occurred after the colleges had made all or most of their final decisions for admission. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic should have minimal if any impact on current high school seniors applying to colleges for the Fall nor on their ability to get financial aid. Where they will be affected is in their decision process to select a college to attend, and how that experience will be in the Fall of 2020. Normalcy is not expected until the Fall of 2021…….. And the ones who are affected the most are the current high school juniors who will be attempting to apply to colleges in the Fall of 2020, and that will be an unique experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really???? What responsible parent would take their 2 year old child to a 3+ hour baseball game in a crowded stadium (forget the pandemic for now)? Sorry, but I just believe certain things like that , which are not for the benefit of the child are not good for the child….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All they will see is the name of the store/agency (Shein) and the total amount. For example, if you go to the grocery store and buy 40 different items for $95, the bank shows the name of the store and the $95, not the complete itemized receipt. Just as a note: One should only use a debit card at a bank’s ATM to withdraw money. One should use a credit card anywhere else. If the debit card is stolen and misused you are responsible for the entire amount that is stolen. Whereas, with a credit card, if you report the theft/loss in a reasonable time, you are only responsible for the first $50 with most credit card companies….. Just a note…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the big “scheme of things”, it shouldn’t cost anything (or a very nominal amount) if you change the name on the ticket to someone else in your immediate family (living at the same location): spouse or child. What the airlines want to prohibit is someone making a business out of: Buying tickets when the price is low, reselling the ticket for an increased price (but less than what the airline currently is charging), and changing the name on the ticket. Call the airline, speak to the customer service representative and explain the details. If you are honest about, don’t have a history of doing it, and the new person is a family member, then it is pretty easy for the airline to say Yes and charge nothing or a nominal amount. Just be Professional, Polite and Not repetitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who says that colleges will be accepting the 2020 AP test results for credit??? Credit decisions are made over the summer once you have enrolled and paid your nonrefundable deposit.

If the sponsor of that research wants only US students (citizens or permanent residents) to work on the research (typically per Federal decree), then no international students are allowed. Otherwise, graduate student applicants from India are in the “driver’s seat”: They already have an excellent command of the English language Many of the colleges in India are excellent and well respected in the USA Indeed, at MIT over 320 of the 6,900 graduate students hold citizenship from India, the second largest after those from China. MIT | International Students Office Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For us in the engineering field, we invite job applicants who have a resume that shows some relationship to the type of technical assistance we need to come in for an interview. The interview includes: The applicant makes a ~45 minute presentation to us on their senior capstone project, their thesis or some major project(s) that they led that demonstrates their engineering capability We ask a lot of penetrating questions and expect excellent answers Then the candidate meets privately for 30+ minutes (each) with one or two of the senior engineering staff After all of that technical discussion, there is no reason to ask “Why should we hire you”? It is obvious or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would a stealthy airplane need to fly supersonicly? What does “speed” buy you? The very stealthy B-2A bomber and I expect the even more stealthy B-21 bomber are subsonic. Yes, the F-22A and the three versions of the F-35 can fly supersonicly for some period of time. But that would be in adversary interceptor roles, where the time to get from the air base to within 50 nautical miles (or so) of the enemy aircraft is important. Then they would go subsonic and in a stealthy fashion attack the adversary. Deep penetrating bombers or attack aircraft do not have that interceptor role. The truly stealthy aircraft needs to be able to fly 6000+ nautical miles (total) to “silently” and with maximum stealth, get to a target, identify and verify the target, deliver a weapon on the target and then “slide away” and disappear on a different route to safety. Period. And with satellites using all sorts of sensors to gather information, then one does not need supersonic aircraft for that either…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is what I remember: Develop a rapport with the teacher and ask questions or seek a little extra help before or after class or before or after school, Ask to be allowed to do extra projects to assist in your learning and to bolster your grades Seek help from peers. I assisted others in school by tutoring them or volunteering to be their lab partners. Read some science related articles in available scientific publications like Scientific American, Technology Review, etc. that can stimulate your thinking about science Get your mathematics knowledge rock-solid as mathematics is the language of science and engineering Enjoy it, it can be a lot of fun Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Currently the SAT is scheduling a SAT test in mid-September. If that test is given, then you had better have an excellent reason why you don’t have a SAT test score.

<|startoftext|>From my experience in attending MIT, in interviewing prospective freshmen for MIT over a 40+ year period, and knowing many others who attended elite Private US colleges: The people who are admitted to MIT and the other elite private US colleges, tend to be: The Go To people in their school: If something has to be done, then the peer students, teachers and school administrators look to these people to “get it done and done well” Or the person is a fine person and an outstanding athlete who is recruited to play on that college’s varsity team Or that person truly stands out as a leader in some activity in their local extended community Read this article, the links and the full report (one of the links) as MIT, Harvard and 80+ other US top educational institutions wrote the report in 2016 to tell people what they are seeking in successful freshman applicants: Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And the person needs Glowing Hot letters of recommendation to substantiate that. And, those people typically burned the “candle” at both ends and the middle, and still remained healthy and social with family and friends. Excellent time management is exceedingly important as it is the key to survival at those top colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is the advice that I gave to our two sons when they graduated college and started working for companies in 2013 and 2014…. Your companies do Not have a pension plan Put 10% of your gross salary into your company’s 401K plan, and That is your pension plan Hopefully, your company will match some of that contribution Anything over 10% (including the company’s contribution) is “your real 401K like mine”, since I have a pension plan If you follow the 10% guidance, then make certain you have Paid off your student loans Have at least six months expenses (half of one year’s total expenses) in cash in a bank account Have any additional money that you need to save for a down payment on a home Pay your credit card statements in Full each and every month BEFORE you put any more money into your 401K plan Remember, you are allowed, under IRS rules, to put additional money into your 401K when you turn 50 years old: 401k Plan Catch up Contribution Eligibility You may have children before you turn 50 years old, and therefore, you are Responsible for assisting them in attending college (per USA Federal, State, Local government guidelines, colleges’ assumptions and Ethically), and you should Not touch your 401K to assist in paying for a child’s college education. Finally, who quits working entirely at age 61? Most people I know love to work either full time or part time until they are 70 or older. If we have careers that we love, then there is still time to work and vacation and travel. You are on the correct track, but think through some of what I wrote. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For personal travel, I only buy airline tickets directly from the airline and on the airline’s web site. For business, my company goes through a very reputable third party that buys the tickets for us from the airline. Too many “bad things can happen” with airline travel so it does not pay to try for short-cuts in my opinion. Also, when traveling nationally or internationally, I always select One airline for all flights unless the flights are spaced at least a Day apart. I never try to fly from A to C via B and use two different airlines with less than 12 hours between flights. Again, Bad Things can and will happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That has happened to three colleges, locally (Boston area) A small college in New Hampshire had switched from non-profit to “for profit” (Part of ITT educational services) and then had to dissolve. Fortunately, a near-by private college stepped in and agreed to take most (if not all) of the students into that college’s programs or assist in their transferring to other colleges A small college in Boston that was primarily for training school teachers was absorbed into Boston University and became a teaching college within BU A not-to-small college on some Prime property was bought by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the students were allowed to shift to campuses within the UMass system, and in the case of some specialty degrees (undertaker training for example), UMass continued to operate the degree program at that campus until they all graduated. So, in the three cases that I am relatively familiar with, another near-by college or college system stepped in to assist with the process. I am certain that some students felt that they weren’t served well in the transition, but in every case the Attorney General of that State did a very detailed investigation to make certain that all of the current students received some basic and required assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With their parents’ permission, at any age. We told our sons that they could change their first or last name at age 12. We double-checked with them at age 12 and then again at age 13 and they were pleased with their names and kept them. However, once the person is an Adult (age 18 in most states in the USA), then they can change their name on their own. NOTE: There has to be a “background” check involved in a name change. Consult a lawyer. That is to prevent someone avoiding a criminal warrant or a civil suit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the time they are 8, I ask the child if they want a booster. If they say no, then they have to be able to properly fasten themselves with the seat belt and shoulder harness in the vehicle, typically in a rear seat.

Just Do It and less fretting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. In the USA, you need permission to post a flyer on private property and most local communities do not allow flyers posted in public spaces.

<|startoftext|>From the time our children were toddlers, they had Chores to do. They are members of a family and they had to do what family members are supposed to do. So, there were no “chores for pay” in the family. There were the Expected things that All family members are supposed to do. And, every family member should have some reasonable (not too much) pocket cash in case they need something. Otherwise, they, like we, determine why they need something, and with that justification we assist in buying that “something”. However, all along we all realize that we need to have good credit, necessities, maybe a nice family vacation once per year, gifts to give other family members at special days, and to save for future college or apprenticeship. Be a Parent and teach frugality and living within your means, and teach the children to save in a bank account (ours all had a savings account prior to starting school). Do Not pay a child to do chores. A child should be a member of a family and pull-their-own-weight with the family and do the things that family members are supposed to do. Then when they are 16, make certain they go out into the world during the Summer and get a Job, while still doing their family chores around the home just like the adults…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First it is not really that high. The suicide rate for 18 to 25 year old males and females is about 1.3 per 10,000 people. There are 12,000 undergraduate, graduate and special students at MIT, for example. There are between 1 and 2 suicides per year. That is roughly what one would expect. People have mental issues or get overly depressed and stressed out and………….. who knows…… The same is true of all of the elite private research universities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are many US citizens who attend high schools in other countries (think diplomats’ children as a great example). They are still US citizens and if they have an active and valid US passport then the colleges will treat them as US applicants. However, a number of people who “think” they are dual US and Canadian citizens based upon “word of mouth” have been rejected when they applied for an US passport. If you have the passport you are “Good to Go” in applying to US colleges as an US citizen. If you don’t have an active and valid US passport, then get one before applying to the colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are No Level-5 fully autonomous cars in the USA. Period. There are a number of experimental cars that REQUIRE a licensed driver to be seated in the driver’s seat and able to take full control of the vehicle. But none that are fully autonomous and certainly none that are fully autonomous and allowed to operate with no legal driver in any US state. There may be some very limited versions in the mid-2030’s They have a Long way to go yet to be achieve Level 5 autonomy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rules??? NCAA merely restricts the players to be Amateurs and not professionals in their sport. All of the US national teams work with the NCAA to make certain that all of the current college athletes maintain their amateur status. Typically, their costs can be paid for: Transportation Hotel Reasonable per diem for food However, since the National Team works that out with the NCAA, the student athlete merely follows the lead of the national team and keeps their college’s athletic director apprised. No issue. What can be an issue, is for a High School student to be on a national sports team. There are 52 high school governing bodies (each state has one, and NY and California have two by dividing the state in half by population). Therefore the high school student athlete must follow the rules of their State association and that can be confusing…. There are several top high school athletes who have run afoul of the amateurism rules of their state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, you are Already in the USA, and either your spouse or your parent is on a F-1 student visa.

<|startoftext|>I am going to be Brutally honest: For International Freshman applicants: There are only five colleges in the USA that do Not care that you are poor. MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Amherst College are the only US colleges that are Need-Blind for international freshman applicants. Period. They will provide up to and including full-financial aid for all students who are admitted. Period. However, there are many elite Private colleges, that also will meet up to and including full-financial aid for an international freshman applicant After you are admitted, but will hold asking for any financial aid Against you during the admissions process. Stanford and Caltech and Columbia, and Brown and Dartmouth are excellent examples. All of those colleges are interested in Great People who also are excellent students. Therefore, you can get admitted. However, if you are an international freshman applicant to the elite Private US colleges, then first take the published overall acceptance rate for freshman applicants and divide that by Three for an international applicant. And if you are poor and applying to one of the colleges that is Not one of those five listed above, then divide that result by at Least two if not three. And it costs a Lot of money to apply to US colleges……. And for the large Public colleges, they give very little money to any international undergraduate students, and they may admit you and then tell you that you owe $60,000 USD per year to attend and then leave it up to you to figure out where to get that money if you really want to attend….. UNLESS: If you are male and a truly great Basketball player (on your nation’s youth national team or over 7 feet 3 inches tall and athletic) then the NCAA D-1 varsity basketball coach will have a huge influence on your admission and if admitted your total cost of attendance will be Zero, everything will be free. Similarly, if you are female and one of the best basketball, gymnastics, volleyball or tennis athletes in your country, then you can attend a NCAA D-1 college for free (fully-funded). On the other hand, if you want to be a Graduate student in a STEM field in the USA, then there are many fully-funded international graduate students in the USA. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, you are Not applying for FAFSA. You are using the FAFSA online application forms to apply for US Federal financial aid, and many colleges also use that data to judge whether to grant you additional financial aid. And if the $25,000 in stock are in your name, then the college will expect, that over the four years that you attend that college, you will sell that stock and use the proceeds to pay for your education. Since it is Your money, then they expect you to use to Pay. Enjoy college and enjoy paying for it. You pay for everything in life…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. There are few colleges that offer Early Decision admission (which is a Contract that the applicant and the parents Sign), and those colleges have a lot of money and all have an agreement among themselves to follow a process of evaluating the FAFSA (if an US applicant) and the CSS Profile form data and awarding financial aid based upon need. Indeed, all Early Decision colleges promise to meet Full Verified (by the college) Need. And for those colleges, if anyone is to be offered less aid, it may be during regular admission when some of the financial aid money runs out….. If you are willing to sign a contract and ethically agree to attend if admitted, then a college that offers early decision will meet all of your verified financial need. But no more than that. Therefore, that can mean No financial aid if the college does not believe you need aid. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are very few “full-ride” scholarships. And far fewer for merit than for sports. I use the scholarship to mean regardless of need. There are a lot of full-financial aid Grants given to excellent students from very poor families, but for that you must be admitted to one of the elite Private US colleges, many of which offer no scholarships. Being an excellent student that the college wants, will, especially for the large Public colleges, get them to “open their wallets” and offer a nice merit scholarship, but no where near full, unless they are trying to Lure you away from Princeton or Stanford or MIT (etc.). And there are relatively few of those. And for sports, there are few sports that award a full athletic scholarship: For men: tackle football and basketball For women: basketball, gymnastics, tennis and volleyball All others get a partial athletic scholarship, that many times does not even cover the full tuition and rarely the room & board. College Athletic Scholarship Limits However, for the few colleges that play NCAA D-1 ice hockey (male or even fewer female) that is nearly a full athletic scholarship. And you do Not have to be a Valedictorian to get a merit scholarship. Just be an excellent student that the college really wants. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is a fluid decision. There is a SAT exam scheduled for mid-September. Sign-up for that. If that is cancelled then many colleges will fore-go the SAT requirement. However, if that test is given and you don’t take it, then…………………………………………………………………………………<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as I know, whatever payment plan that a college offers, is offered to All students, US and international. I will discuss this for colleges with a two-term academic year. If the college starts towards the end of August, then Full payment for the first term is typically due by early July. However, that same college (either online through the bursar’s office or through a 3rd party financial institution) will allow three or four payments for the money owed for the first term, Plus a fee (~$50 to $60) for the payment plan (per term). If three payments, then Aug 1, Sept 1 and Oct 1. If four then add in by July 1st as well. Similarly for the Spring term, with first payment due ~ Dec 1st (or Jan 1st). Most colleges in the USA offer that. Why not? They are getting their money and you Pay for the payment plan…… Win-win Enjoy college in the USA and good luck with the F-1 visa process…… (Remember that the mandatory deposit is nonrefundable…..)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of public schools will carry a very large Freshman team in most sports and as long as you try and as long as you make every practice and game (unless excused by the coach or the school) there are many programs with No cuts from a freshman team. Therefore, this summer, as soon as fields reopen, get out there and get some practice. Have good players hit balls to you. Lots of throwing and catching from various angles and movements. Then get to a batting cage and pump in “quarters” and hit Hundreds of softballs of various speed and movement. As for a position to try-out for….. Obviously not pitcher as you have no experience. If you are an ice hockey goaltender, then maybe catcher. People will yell at me, but consider 2nd base and right field. (I played 2nd base and catcher in men’s D-1 fast pitch softball). However, a good coach will watch you, work with you, and find the best spot for you on the Team. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be very, very, very (did I say very?) wary of any US-based “college” that is not approved to receive Title IV Federal Student Aid funds. There is a Reason……… Be wary and try not to get scammed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have not been published yet. Don’t expect this to take effect until 2021–22 season at the earliest. I expect two things: An escrow account for the money paid to a student athlete to use the athlete’s image or for an endorsement. Rules would then be in place as to when the athlete can access that money in the escrow account The student-athlete will be allowed to have an agent for this I expect that the NCAA will require any of those agents to be licensed by the NCAA and be subjected to an extensive background check. I certainly hope so. My opinions only.

<|startoftext|>It is highly Unethical, but there is little stopping you. You would pay a several hundred dollar (or more) nonrefundable deposit to each of the two colleges, and then request a gap-year from each of the two colleges, so that you start classes the following Fall. If they each agree, then you would need to withdraw from one of those two colleges before you are required to pay for the complete first term (following June/July). Indeed, you could be even more unethical and enroll in a third college and forfeit both nonrefundable deposits. However, NEVER tell anyone that you did that. That is something shameful. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In international soccer, under FIFA Laws, there are no time outs and for the eleven starting players, there are only three substitutions allowed for the entire game. Therefore, by “over reacting” to the foul/injury, the player gains a little more time to be treated on the field before the player is removed from the field, the team plays short-handed and then the player is waved back onto the field by the referee. Therefore, the over reacting “buys more time” and everyone, especially the injured player, gets an unofficial Time Out. Simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am unfamiliar with that specific program at Brandeis Apply However, I know many Brandeis students who have gone on to Medical and Dental school and Brandeis has an excellent biology research group and graduate program. Therefore, if any college can offer a post bachelors degree training to meet the medical school prerequisites, then I trust Brandeis to be able to do that very well. However, Medical School in and of itself, is Very expensive, unless you can get into a Medical School with free tuition like NYU. Cost of Attendance Calculator It is not inexpensive and I doubt there is much in the way of financial aid. This is a Huge commitment on your part, especially if you have student loans from your undergraduate education. But, if you are Dedicated then the medical schools will Love you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. MIT has reciprocal agreements with Harvard, Wellesley College and Olin College of Engineering. Also, MIT graduates are professors at Boston University, Tufts and Northeastern, so it may be possible to do some lab work at MIT to support the professor’s research at those other colleges. And, it is always “possible” if your professor knows a MIT professor very well and you are doing some leading-edge research, that you may be able to get a summer slot at one of the MIT lab’s. MIT also allows excellent students from historically minority colleges in the USA to attend MIT for one term or one academic year. My roommate the spring of my freshman year was an African-American junior who spent a term at MIT studying physics and mathematics. (He later returned to earn a PhD). There is always a chance, but your chance is Much better if you are a student at Wellesley College, Harvard or Olin College. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Correct, Harvard College of Harvard University has no quotas for US applicants (citizens, permanent residents and legal refugees). However, Harvard along with most if not all of the elite Private US colleges have self-imposed quotas on International Undergraduate students. MIT’s is 10% and Harvard’s is 12%. That is applauded by all of the Federal, State and Local governments because those colleges pay no taxes, and those tax payers do not want a lot of that money going to international undergraduate students. Enjoy the process of applying to US colleges to be a freshman. Your chances are about one-third that of the overall admission rate, so that means slightly less than 2% for Harvard. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They will want to see your Passport and any other identification you have. Your visa to another country is not even considered.

And do you have any money in your bank account? And have you switched your bank account from a joint account with your mother to an account only in your name? Do you have a job?

<|startoftext|>No. No elite private college wants to hear any more from you once you agree to remain on the Wait List. The wait list is Not weighted and the college has already stated that they really like you by placing you on their wait list, but you just missed the regular round acceptance list. However, the chances of being admitted from the wait list are tiny. Just accept another college, pay the nonrefundable deposit and forget about Columbia. If you did get accepted from the wait list you can surprised at a later date without any worrying. Enjoy your social distancing during the pandemic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Put your dream on hold. A friend’s daughter had this dream of attending an excellent (superb) nursing program at a private college in the heart of the Boston medical district. With financial aid, the annual cost was “only” $36,000 but the family could only afford $18,000 However, she had also been accepted by a fine state college that had a great nursing program near the state’s medical school….. And the net cost? $16,000 per year. I told her to put her dream on hold, attend the state college, get a job in the medical district after college, work hard and then have her hospital pay for her to get her Masters in nursing at the great private college. She did and has just completed that free Masters at that dream college………. Put that dream on hold for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Once you send the college what they ask for they do not want to hear from you again and any further contact could ruin your chances. The wait list is Not weighted, and the college truly wants you if a slot opens. However, that slot would need to be someone like you who has decided not to attend that college, so the college then asks you to fill that vacant slot. Make certain that you accept another college and pay the nonrefundable deposit because there is a very small chance of being accepted off the wait list to an elite private college. Better chance at a large public college, but they still do Not want to be bothered by you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First MIT and most if not all of the elite private universities take very few transfer students (because so few undergraduates leave before graduating, therefore there are very few openings). Couple that with MIT’s self-imposed Quota on international undergraduate students of 10%, if no international student has left early there is No room to accept an international transfer student. Second, if you do want an excellent chance (assuming there is an opening), then you will need the Full support of your team. Your team will include at least two professors and the head of your department at your current college. Hopefully at least one of them is professionally known by professors at MIT. Then your team will contact the MIT department into which you wish to transfer and explain why you Really Need to transfer and why they Fully support your transfer. Without the full and complete support of your team, you will have almost zero chance of transferring. Instead MIT has No quotas on international Graduate students and over 40% of the far larger graduate student community are international. Therefore, do extremely well at your current college and use that Team to assist you in becoming a fully-funded graduate student at MIT in a few years. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

Since 85% of the people in the schools are students, and if they are All immune to the virus then with simple precautions the older adults should be fine. Therefore, it is the Duty of everyone 22 or younger (down to age 6) to get the COVID-19 virus this summer and recuperate before school in the Fall. Simple.

<|startoftext|>Public universities are horribly underfunded, in general. The tuition for the in-state students is artificially low, and most public universities do not have much of an endowment. The UC system has a Lot of students (30,000 undergraduates Each at UCLA and Berkeley as an example) and those colleges believe they are underfunded by the California legislature that gets its money from the tax payers. If you have the resume of someone who Could get into one of the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League, MIT, or Stanford, then the public university (UC) may throw a bunch of money your way to convince you to not go private but to stay in-state and make the UC system look good. Everyone else???? You get a BIG break on in-state tuition. That’s it. More Money??? You must be kidding…….. That will be their response….. As a resident of CA, an UC costs about $36,000 per year (and that is a Bargain) and a Cal Poly or a CSU costs about $29,000 per year (and that is a Real bargain). So you want cheaper than an UC? Head to a Cal Poly or a CSU instead. And for engineering, a Cal Poly is just as good as a UC…. And if you are Not a resident of CA, then you must be Crazy, Filthy Rich or a Student Athlete to be attending an UC……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Street sports or spontaneous playing of sports by children, has disappeared in many areas around the USA. Including my home town. We all used to ride around on our bicycles with baseball glove on the handle bars and we played pick-up baseball all the time. My side yard was the local neighborhood tack (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can’t have a serious discussion with your father and make a convincing case for your major, then how are you going to survive on your own??? Parents will listen to Reason. Sit down and list the reasons why your intended major is reasonable for You and how you will be able to support yourself in that chosen career and then sit down with your parents and have polite Discussion and tell them those reasons. If your father isn’t convinced that you understand the economics of your choices then suggest that you Borrow the money from him at some reasonable interest rate and you will start paying him back four years after you first start college. You have to believe in yourself. That should all work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. With $3,000 And a job for 40 hours per week that pays at least $12.50 per hour, you should be fine. Find a shared apartment or house with a congenial group that needs another housemate and you are OK. Figure on (roughly) a $1,100 per month for rent, utilities and basic food. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the USA: that would be age 18 or older. First you would need a passport, and in the USA you need parental consent to get a passport under the age of 18: Getting or Renewing a U.S. Passport | USAGov Second, how would you pay for any travel expenses if you don’t have a credit card, and you can’t get a credit card (on your own) until you are at least 18 in the USA. So, once you are 18 and have graduated from high school, Move out, get a job, a passport, a credit card, and then travel as far as your savings will take you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in the USA, but…………. What are you trying to achieve? NASA works on Aviation or Aeronautics (the first A in NASA) or on space projects, you could work for an Aviation or a Space company, or like Airbus which does a little of both. Or you get on the research staff at a University. Like this: ssl.umd.edu There are universities around the world working on A and S (out of NASA…) Canada has a space agency. The UK will soon have their own Space Agency if they leave the EU. There must be space agencies in Russia, China, India, etc. So, look around and find access to jobs related to Aeronautics and/or Space in your current country or region. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are three basic costs associated with hosting the Olympics: Cost of building venues and housing units and upgrading the local infrastructure Cost of security during the games Loss of economic revenue from other events/business that were cancelled during the Olympics Indeed, until 1984, most of the modern Olympics lost money. Then in 1984 Los Angeles built only one thing (a velodrome) and that was donated by a local business. Other than that, they had to spend little and made a ton of money. That is why Paris and Los Angeles will be hosting the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics. They are ready for it already and will make a Ton of money for their local city and their country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, you may. However, if it is English as a second language, then the colleges are looking for your ability to: * Think critically * Write well * Present your ideas well verbally in a class room setting If your English teacher can address all three of those, then fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they will. And they will look very closely at what your guidance counselor writes about you. Colleges want Mature students who can work well independently. If you are a “screw-up” during this several week “school at home and online”, then you are not what they are interested in. Don’t screw up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the US legally goes after FIFA in order to get the World Cup in the USA two times in a row????????????? No. There may be “fines paid” and people arrested, but the World Cup will be in Qatar, or maybe split between France and Italy as an economic stimulus after the pandemic…… That would make a lot more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are people who do that. The real questions are: By what means of transport, How long will the commute take in each direction, Cost of the commute in “money”? I know people who do an 80 mile each way commute. Some by personal car, and some by commuter rail. The ones on the commuter rail many times relax and get work done or personal things done or play cards or chess with other passengers…… So, it depends….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really, but they don’t need to. The elite private US colleges require: Complete transcript Letter from your high school guidance counselor or your school’s headmaster that describes you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person, That letter accompanies the official transcript and there also must be a copy of the Secondary School report that is sent to the college by this person. That report describes the types and levels of courses taught at your school, the grading philosophy of your school, the percentage of graduates who go to college, the colleges that previous graduates of your school have attended, etc. etc. etc. Two teachers that you select must write a letter of recommendation and submit that to the college on your behalf Any supplemental letters of recommendation that the college allows or encourages Standardized test scores And every one of those elite private colleges has a huge database on every school in the world from which anyone has ever applied to that college and what happened to that person (no ID info, merely “data”). Additionally, the college has info from the admissions staff members who have visited your country and the college’s alumni volunteers who are in your country. Less worrying and more enjoying high school and the college application process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stanford would Never have accepted that person if Stanford did not believe in that person. Stanford believes that person has the academic prowess and the work ethic to attend the college, survive freshman year, do well in a major, graduate in a timely fashion and be all that they believe they can be in their chosen intercollegiate sport. And a fair number of Stanford alumni have gone on to become professional athletes. Tell them Not to worry and to enjoy Stanford for the community, the education and the athletics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, in the USA, people are paid an amount that is related to the amount of money they bring into the organization. Many of those college football coaches bring in many Millions of dollars of “profit” to the college even after they are paid a few millions of dollars. By profit, I mean the money left over after all of the “football related” expenses are subtracted from the football related income. Indeed, the Presidents of many colleges are paid millions based on the amount of money they bring into the college from donations. Simple. Just like an actor or a professional athlete or a singer etc. They are paid a percentage of what they bring in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That will vary widely from town to town and from high school to high school. At some high schools it is a Rigorous club that trains constantly and enters competitions in addition to performing at high school athletic events. At other schools it is a club for the “cool girls to hang out” and try to get the male athletes as boyfriends. (Indeed our school is like that, and I would Never allow a daughter to be a “cheer leader” at our high school……) So, take your parents to see the practices and speak with the Cheer Coach. However, check it out in advance just in case your cheer group is like the one at our town’s school and then you will embarrass yourself in front of your parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recognize you????????? More than likely, you will be interviewed by a different US consulate staff member. However, that person will have a file on you which includes every interaction you have had with a US government agency, and if you applied for a visa in the past, the results of the extensive background check they ran on you at that time. Indeed, before you arrive for the interview, they will have another back ground check run on you. Local police, Interpol, etc. etc. etc. Just Be You, less worrying and enjoy the process. A disguise is not required and actually discouraged….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is Infant, toddler, pre-school, Kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, and high school (teenage) child. Those terms work the USA. If you say: I have an elementary school child. People will know that the child is somewhere between 6 and 11. A general age range. Like being a high schooler. That is more definitive than being a teenager….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vast majority of US colleges (public and private) will do something this Fall. They may open or they may go online for the Fall or they may do some combination. However, if you believe that is detrimental to your educational goals, then see if you can Withdraw for one year. During that year work in your home country and gain some experience, money and maturity. Then, hopefully, in the Fall of 2021 everything will be essentially back to normal, and after you travel to Japan for the Summer Olympics, you will continue to the USA on your updated F-1 visa and continue your education at your current US college. However, if you are from a country that has had Issues with the USA, then be wary about regaining a F-1 student visa….. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK………….. Spring grades……………. You don’t have your Spring grades yet as the Spring term of most colleges is not finished, and USC should know that. Obviously, if you are Accepted as a transfer student, then USC will need your complete transcript from your current college to assure itself you are still a good student making progress towards a degree And to determine which credits will transfer. This is a Good thing. It sounds to me that USC, due to the pandemic, is delaying acceptances until later in the Spring. Respond to USC and tell them when your Spring term will be complete and that your college should send them your final transcript withing a couple of weeks of that last date. Double check with your current college first to find out when the transcript will be ready. Good luck,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For over 4 years I lived near UCLA in Brentwood ( a section of West LA). UCLA is in Westwood and surrounded by very nice and in some cases wealthy neighborhoods. To me, UCLA was always a little piece of heaven on Earth. But I may be understating that…..<|endoftext|>

A MLB team plays 162 games and best of 7 play off series…. It is all in balance….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a Co-Op student (2nd term junior year at MIT from Feb - Aug) I received full and reasonable pay from the aerospace company and Credits from MIT. Therefore, talk to various colleges that offer a major related to your business/industry and offer 4 to 6 month Co-Op jobs. You get a good worker and the student gets a pay check and credit, and you get to evaluate workers for future hiring. Win, win, win, win. Seems obvious to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I and all of my large extended family attended Public schools and we all did fine. However, we were all in suburban settings with good or very good public schools. I referee high school and college soccer, public, private and private boarding schools. Here is my take on private schools If you live in a very Urban area (large city) and your child can’t get into a good exam school (magnet public school) than most parents will pay to send their child to a good Catholic day school or a good non-denominational private day school Then there are those in the suburbs who are wealthy. If their child does not have a good fit in the “large” public school (no matter how good it is) they will pay to send their child to a very good private day school. I have seen families with multiple children and some will attend the very good public school and the others will attend an very good private day school, Some wealthy parents want their children to have a better chance to play high level sports in a good setting and also get a shot at the elite private colleges, and they will pay to send their child to an elite (expensive) private school (money is not a factor to them) Some children are into art or dance or music or a trade and therefore the family will send them to a good private day school that emphasizes those types of courses. Finally, some families are very wealthy and the mother and father are really busy with their careers and functions/activities and don’t have time for their children so they will spend upwards of $80,000 per year to send them to an elite private boarding school As long as the child is thriving and money is not a factor, then everything is Fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Setting Airplane mode on your smart phone, quickly turns off: Cell service Blue Tooth WiFi At that point, you can, obviously Play local games Watch videos that are stored on your phone Or most likely, listen to music that is stored on your phone However, many airlines will allow you to turn on your blue-tooth connectivity to allow you to use wireless ear phones (buds) And many will provide WiFi so you can turn on your WiFi to “surf the internet” or watch videos or listen to music provided by the airline. The only way to get Cell connectivity back is to turn-off Airplane mode. However, when you do that, you may still have to selectively toggle WiFi and Blue Tooth back on separately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To be a college athlete in the USA< you must be an amateur. If one is paid for endorsements etc related to their college sports play, then they would be considered a professional and barred from any further college sports play. However, the NCAA is currently establishing a process that most likely will be in place for the 2021–22 sports season so that NCAA college athletes can get paid for endorsements and the use of their image. Stay tuned. It is coming, but will only be for a very select Few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as I know, anyone who graduates from a good UK university is treated the same way as any US college graduate when applying to be a PhD student at an US research university.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, we refer to high school as “secondary school”, and therefore college is post-secondary school. Whereas, K-8th grade is Primary education. And someone who completes their high school education is referred to as a high school graduate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless the college took out a restraining order against you, if you are expelled or even just graduated and are part of the alumni, you are only allowed to go where the general public is allowed to go on that college’s campus. If current students invite you to visit them in their dormitory, then you may go there. However, be on your Best behavior because if Campus Police have to deal with you then the college will take out a retraining order against you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically, if you are Not listed as a dependent on anyone’s Federal tax return for 2018 or 2019 and You have a social security number and filed a Federal tax return in either 2018 or 2019, then yes you should get a stimulus check, based on the stimulus income limitations. Enjoy college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get yourself into Peak physical shape. Upper and lower body strength. Running, jumping and leaping ability. Then sign-up for the best Rugby program while you are in college either on campus or in your local area. Become one of the meanest, most fearsome and skilled rugby player and then play some football for at least one full season at a local top amateur football program. All of those coaches will know someone who knows someone in the NFL coaching and scouting staff. That path could get you to the NFL by the time you are 25 years old. Alternatively, if you attend a good NCAA D-3 college with a football team, then be a walk-on player, forget the Rugby path, and then go to the local top amateur program for one to two years after college. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only really assured way to get any financial aid for college in the USA, is to apply to the college by following their financial aid web site that is listed on the admissions web site. There is very Little financial aid for international undergraduate students from Public colleges in the USA. However, many of the Private colleges in the USA will provide up to and including full financial aid, however you and all of your parents will need to fill out the daunting CS Profile forms each year, which will be verified by an agency in your country that is trusted by the college. Apply for College Financial Aid – CSS Profile – The College Board In order to gain a better feel for the various colleges in the USA, sign-up for free at University & College Search Tool Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. The only requirement (as far as I know) to get a degree at a local community college is to have either a high school diploma or a GED certificate. And if you have neither, then a community college will assist you in studying for and then taking the GED exam. I believe, that over the last 25 to 30 (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You train in the off-season, and show up pre-season for your community college’s track team and demonstrate your ability to the head coach. Simple. If you community college does not have a track team, then join a local track club and work-out. Then submit your times to the four-year university head track coach while transferring in. You can also try to “run-on” the track team at that college as a junior. There is plenty of room for a good runner who is willing to train hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Most if not all of the elite Private US colleges require a transfer applicant to actually provide more in their application than a high school student applying to be a freshman and the admission percentage for transfers is one percent or less. You will be required to submit: Complete high school transcript, with a cover letter from your high school guidance counselor, Complete college transcript, At least two letters of recommendation from current college professors, Standardized test results (SAT/ACT and any required or highly recommended SAT subject test scores, and possibly a TOEFL score), Letters of recommendation that show what a great person you have been at your current college and how, through extracurricular activities at your current college or in your extended local community you have collectively demonstrated: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character. It will be far easier to get your bachelors degree from your current college and then become a fully-funded graduate student at a top US research university than to transfer as an undergraduate. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the better NCAA D-3 soccer players I played with, was the New England champion in the 400 meter high hurdles. Very difficult to defend against.

Just like an airplane that has a fully-fueled 6,000 mile range, but is only flying to an airport 4,000 miles way, won’t load a full fuel load…. Liquid fuel for rockets and airplanes is very heavy and a huge percentage of the take-off weight. You only carry what you need.

<|startoftext|>Safe??? The children??? For the 5 to 18 year old children, the death rate is the same as it was for Measles prior a vaccine becoming available in 1963. And we all got the measles and spent two weeks in isolation at home. And measles is three-times more contagious than COVID-19 Safe? They will be just as safe as we all were from the pre-1963 measles. And we were much more worried about polio and tuberculosis. If 85% of the school children get and recover from COVID-19 over the summer, then schools will be very safe, even for the adults who work there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not really. The cream always rises to the top, so the students who are admitted to the elite private US universities will be the same. And the number of college students is diminishing, and with a decrease in international students, there will be a lot of room for all of the US applicants who wish to attend college. High school classes 2022 and 2023 will find a Bright future in college. Good luck and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides? Those two don’t even make the list My two favorite are: Boeing 787 Boeing 757 For obvious reasons.

<|startoftext|>Huh?? I work for a company. If I rent a car for a business trip, the company pays for the cost of the rental and the cost of any fuel that I put in the car, and the cost of any tolls. Whereas, if I drive my own car, the company pays me the current Federally approved mileage for using the car, and the cost of any tolls. However the mileage covers the cost of the fuel. And I also am self-employed as a soccer referee. I am allowed to claim the current Federally approved mileage for the business use of my car. However, if my car is not available, and I rent a car, then, just like for the company I work for, I can claim the cost of the rental plus the cost of the fuel. You can’t get both.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The “year” you are in and when you graduate are two different things in high school. You are a junior, typically if you will be 16 years old at the start of the school year. That is an expression or your Age, and hopefully your Maturity. However, you could be taking all sophomore level courses. Indeed, you may not graduate for three more years. You will be a junior and then a senior, and then a senior again, etc. Speak with your guidance counselor when you can. I believe you may find that, given the courses you completed in Italy, the school may call you a “junior” but you may be taking mostly sophomore level classes. Enjoy high school in the USA (and it will be much better in the Fall of 2021) and it can be Ton of Fun!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing if it is an Excused absence. That happened to me several times in elementary school: Chicken pox Measles Mumps Two weeks of isolation each, and there were only three TV stations back then, and only if you put aluminium foil on the antenna….. My school work was sent home to me, and I did it dutifully every day and was actually ahead of the class when I returned to school each time…… However, if you skip school then you are captured and remanded to a juvenile detention facility and we all hope you look good in a jump suit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money back????? Show up at the airport and don’t leave until they fly you home. They are much more likely to put you on an airplane than to refund money. And you want to go home, correct???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even for Halloween. It just is not “correct”. And most if not all schools, public or private, will Ban any political statements that could be confrontational. So, it is Not worth even trying. Because what if you do, then someone takes a picture of you, and then you are admitted to Stanford and someone sends the picture to Stanford and your admission is rescinded? Or 30 years later you are nominate to be a Supreme Court Justice and out comes that pretty picture of you as a high school senior……… Tanked…. Don’t do it. However, if you are in the School Play entitled “The Producers” and you are in the sub-play (within the play) “Springtime for Hitler”, then get someone to attest to that….. Springtime for Hitler - Wikipedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, yes you can, in one way. A private university, like MIT, could cost you $75,000 per year for all college related costs, but MIT may give all of that to you for Free (zero cost) if MIT believes (after you and all of your parents) fill out the FAFSA (if US) forms and the daunting CSS profile forms. However, if you are In-State in California, a year at UCLA or UC Berkeley may cost only $36,000 per year. And if you qualify as really poor or are a highly sought after undergraduate you might go for Free. So, in the MIT case, you get more, $75K versus only $36K per year. But both are one year of free college which, for many is the Same. So is it the cost in Dollars or the Value???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I say to everyone who asks that question: All soccer players are on the ground, at all times. Some part of their body is touching the ground. The infraction is this: “Playing in a manner that is considered Dangerous and in doing so the opponents do not play the ball due to the perceived danger.” Period. A player could perform a bicycle kick and kick the ball 12 inches from your face, and the referee may allow play to continue. Happens all the time at the D-1 professional level. However, if you lie on the ball with your body, and in that process an opponent does not kick the ball because they are afraid of hurting you, then that is an infraction on the player who is lying on the ball. Less worrying and play soccer, it is a wonderful Contact sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to move up to being a high school teacher and working with pre-adults. Do Not teach at the K-2 level at all, and try to stick with 5th grade students, until you can get reassigned to teach 11th and 12th grade almost-adults. We won’t ask how you managed to pass your student teaching…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really??? Neo-Nazis? In general, it is their opinion. However, there is an expectation of safety and not being harassed. If they “touch you” or verbally assail you, then they could be flower children, they are not supposed to do that. And the teachers/administrators will need to know and get them to stop. However, pick your battles wisely. If you report them, Nazis or Flower Children or whatever, then they will notice you and the “non-problems” of before could turn into ugly current problems. Pick your battles wisely. NOTE: If you see or know something, then say something. It is a delicate balance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in the 1970’s, within 24 hours. Today, with all of the on-board computers and not so obvious ways to access and change the settings? It could take a week, a month or more. It takes me four separate steps to change the time in my 2018 car. One would think that the time would automatically change to/from Daylight Savings to Standard, but no. And the path to change it is convoluted. There are still some on-board computer settings I am unfamiliar with, but, therefore, never use. It took me with the car dealer over 15 minutes to pair my cell phone to the car via bluetooth. And that was hit/miss. And with Android Auto on my current phone? About 30 minutes the first time, and that was with a Verizon tech assisting in the car with me….. However, to Drive it? A couple of days. There is the seating position, the visibility out of all of the windows, the day/night feel, etc etc etc. Enjoy the process, it is always fun for me. All of my cars (all) are manual transmission, but it only takes a few minutes to get used to the clutch. However some new cars have “hill assist”, and that can be weird as it can lock-up the car. Turn that off if possible. If you know how to drive a manual transmission car you Do Not need hill assist. And the beeping of the proximity sensors (especially after it snows and some sensors are covered by snow) can be irritating and totally useless. One should have near zero False-Negatives, and we all want negligible false positives, and car manufacturers will err on the side of the negatives and therefore drive us “batty”….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would not use the term worse…. Different. The education will be different. At the four year universities you will have professors who may be leading researchers in their fields. Many of your peers will have been top students previously. At the community college level, the course work and instruction may be aimed at the “middle of the students in your class”…. Therefore, to learn as much as you may at one of the four year universities, you may have to do Extra work/projects and spend a lot of time speaking with your professors during their office hours or before/after class. After 4th grade (a long time ago), you are no longer being “taught”, but you are a Learner who uses all of the resources about you to Learn, including the teachers/professors. Indeed, over the last 30+ years, 20%of those who earned a PhD in the USA, did some of their earlier work in a community college. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, you would contact (phone or mail) the main office of the high school that you attended. If the school has closed, then you would contact the main administrative offices of the school or the school district. The people at those offices would tell you what you would need to send for proof of “who you are”. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh??? I had a baseball bat in my car for “protection”. If I had to get out of my car in a tenuous situation, I used the baseball bat like a cane. A cane is always allowed. Think of Bat Masterson….. Bat Masterson - Wikipedia Check out the TV show. I had one of those Bat Masterson canes as a child…… However, it must be used like a cane until needed for protection. I remember umpiring Little League games years ago. A coach came out to me carrying a baseball bat over his shoulder. Before he was half-way to me, I “tossed him” from the game. He then realized he was still carrying that bat over his shoulder and apologized and left the game. Cane is fine. Over the shoulder is not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will use room mate as someone who shares a living space, but each person has their own individual bedroom. All of the colleges that I am aware of (and freshmen are typically 18 years old), have male and female room mates. And my first apartment when I graduated from college and for the next five years, had male and female room mates. Men and women can be friends. And we treated each other like brothers and sisters. That is Normal in the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to think of colleague as a professional designation. “I love to interact with my aerospace engineering colleagues.” In the USA, I referred to others in college as my classmates or peer students. However, if we are all members of the AIAA student group at our college, for example, then I would refer to the other members as my AIAA colleagues since we are headed to that profession. My opinion only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The F-35B is a STOVL aircraft. Therefore, with a full combat load it is expected to take-off via a short runway, and not completely vertically like a VTOL helicopter. However, the F-35B, after returning to base and with just enough fuel for landing, could land anywhere a UH-60 helicopter could land (roughly). Enjoy the flight and watch out for overhead utility wires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh??? Middle School??? Attend the local public school in your school district, and then arrange to stay in Germany or England or Italy or Spain during the summer of 2021 (as the pandemic is winding down). There will be dozens of professional soccer matches to watch and your child can attend a soccer camp and be “trained the professional way”. Easy. And a very nice 10 week family vacation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh?? Not your first choice, but it had to be one of your top few choices or you bothered a lot of people for letters of recommendation needlessly. If the research topic area suitable to you, and you are fully-funded, then head to that university. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of the commercial airports in the USA are dual-purpose with airlines at one terminal and the USAF at the other end of the airport. Therefore, if an airliner is hijacked it can be shot-down by a F-16, F-15, F-22 or F-35 very quickly. Simple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I attended a small public high school in upstate NY along the Mohawk Valley. We had a wide cross-section of students and I knew everyone. As a freshman at MIT, there were 1,050 other freshmen, I knew one other person when I arrived, however all of the 4,200 (then) undergraduates were all very similar. We were “all similar nerds interested in STEM and interested in interacting with each other.” Indeed we were all selected primarily based on all of the things we liked to do outside of the classroom. Therefore, we all bonded very quickly. Clubs and organizations and teams were easy to join. Room mates all got along. Study groups easily formed. An elite Private US college is Heaven!!! Check them out and find one that is a good fit for you and then you will become a very happy alumnus or alumna. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If we can achieve herd immunity (80%) by September, then yes. That would mean that all children entering 1st through 12th grade in the Fall will need to get the COVID-19 virus, survive (very low death rate for this age group, like measles) and then have the immunity. Since more than 80% of the people in any school are the children, if they have all had the virus and are now immune, that will protect all the adults and it will be trivial to restart school. Sign-up for your two-week period, this summer, to get the virus and recuperate. Just like I and millions did with chicken pox, mumps, measles and rubella. Enjoy the experience. See you in September.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Get a Hartmann carry-on bag with no-wheels. Heavy duty cloth/fabric and excellent zippers and clasps. Light and compressible so it Always fits in the overhead bin. I was one of the last on an airline one time, and the flight attendants were checking the carry-on bags for the passengers ahead of me, and looked at me and said: Take that on, there has to be space for that bag. And there was. And I have gone on eight day business trips with only this carry-on Hartmann bag. If everyone Carried On one of these there would Never be a problem on any airliner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In our town where our two sons went to high school, graduating in 2009 and 2010 from high school, the Families all paid for extracurricular activities. It was a minimum of $200 per sport for the least expensive sport. It was $300 per year for any clubs or activities (one payment of $300 allowed to join as many clubs/activities as you wished). And all of the sports teams had parent support groups which raised money to buy food for away games and to provide all of the team jackets etc. Similarly with the clubs and organizations. And the drama club merely arose from the extensive drama department that our school has and the school paper originates from the journalism classes. All electives. So, from the tax-payer money? Very little. Even the stadium and the track and many of the fields were Donated by alumni or people from the area to support the high school teams as well as all of the youth programs. However, the tax payers pay for maintenance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I know is that one of my dorm mates at MIT was totally blind and that for a while I dated a woman from a near-by college that was totally deaf. They both were excellent students. And today there are a lot of wheel-chair bound students cruising the campuses of US colleges. There is nothing to hold a disabled person back if they have the academic prowess to tackle college. However, mental depression and other mental issues, for that speak with your psychiatrist. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today? With a worldwide pandemic and most places empty with staff working from home? Forget getting into graduate school in 2020 if it entails any thesis work and therefore a research or teaching assistantship. Continue to work in your job and try again for the Fall of 2021. In March of 2021 with an end to the pandemic in sight, there will be a plethora of wonderful graduate student slots available and you will have your pick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biology and arriving at a quick and safe vaccine for the COVID-19 virus by mid-July with a miraculous stockpile ready to go by mid-September. I am certain a medal would be awarded for that…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not read the article close enough to determine the size (volume) and weight of the medical equipment. However, there was a mention of an “empty tank” and the word cargo. A F-16 carries a lot of “stuff” under the wings and body as it has no real weapon bay. Whereas, the F-35A is primarily a stealth aircraft with main weapon bay and few under-wing/body stations for other stuff. It is possible that an empty drop tank could be “stuffed” with the medical equipment. It would be up to the squadron commander’s approval and up to the pilot and maintenance chief’s ingenuity. If it needed to be done, then a flight crew would get it done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MIT requires a letter of recommendation from a humanities teacher. That should be someone who knows you well and can comment on your academic prowess in critical thinking, writing and verbally communicating ideas. If your language teacher can comment on all of that (compared to a teacher of Literature or History), then fine. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let’s see. In 1917 - 1918 there was a pandemic flu and there was no vaccine. 50 million people died which was 2.5% of the world’s population, until there was herd immunity because of the huge number of people who got the flu and recovered with immunity. If there are large gatherings of people with no vaccine, then now with a 2.5% death rate, there will be 200 million people dying of COVID-19 over 12 to 18 months when there finally is a vaccine, which may be too late as there will be herd immunity….. Be prepared for the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds good to me. Schools should have been 80% of the way through the new material, before a review period. Finish up class projects, which one does at home anyway, and then take a final exam. Get a letter grade. Perfect, the way it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That happens around my area (greater Boston area) all the time. Wealthy parents “Lawyer-up” and arm-twist the school district to provide special education for their children. Many of which get “depressed” in 7th and 8th grade and we end up paying over $100,000 per year per child to send them to a private school for the “depressed”. So, just Lawyer Up and you will be surprised what you can achieve if the school district believes it is cheaper to acquiesce. But if you want to send your child to a “normal” private school, that is on you and will cost you between $10,000 to $80,000 per year depending on what the school offers and whether it also is a boarding school. Our sons stayed in the public school because we would never “lawyer-up” to get something that was unnecessary or our fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In our town and in most towns around the greater Boston area, the school grounds, after hours or before hours, are Public park ground. Therefore, people are allowed to walk their dogs in all the public parks as long as the dog is on a leash and the owner cleans up after the dog. That includes the school grounds “after hours”. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as our sons were 4 years old, they carried their own car seats. They were allowed to strap them to their backs if they wanted. I would carry it with two hands and in front of me. However, we rarely if ever took the car seats out of our cars. No need to. If we flew somewhere, we left the car seats in the cars and then rented car seats with the rental car. Simple. No muss and no fuss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Santa Monica Airport used to be one of the best, until the idiots that moved next to the airport realized that airplanes use airports and started to complain. I also like Hanscom Airport in Bedford, MA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life is much more than work/career. And school and college is much more than mere academics. Indeed the elite US private colleges only accept students who will contribute to the college’s undergraduate community Outside of the classroom. High school and college typically will take up about 60 to 65 hours of your week getting to/from class, in class, and doing homework and studying. However, there are 168 hours in every week and slightly more than 52 weeks in each year. A high school academic year in the USA is 180 school days and college is roughly 31 weeks. So, you have to strike a nice balance. Most high school clubs/activities really don’t require that much time. It may seem like they do, but they really don’t. In high school I was on the school news paper for four years and many as editor. We were lucky if we published one issue every four weeks with 8 to 10 pages. At MIT the school newspaper was published Twice per Week and at eight-plus pages per issue. That was a “job”. Same with high school drama club versus college. So in high school you can have a few activities per season possibly including an interscholastic sports. However at college you can only really do one activity per season, especially if you are on an intercollegiate sport’s team. 63 hours for school/college/studying + 63 hours for sleep and health and eating leaves you with 42 hours per week for “other things”. How you use those 42 hours per week is up to you, but remember you have a ton of “hours” during school vacations. Use your time wisely and you will find that you can partake in part-time jobs, clubs, activities, socializing and still be an excellent student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They used to. I took a 1 am flight from LA to Dallas once and several times took 1 am over night flights from Los Angeles to Boston. But that was back in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Now with a combination of noise abatement at most airports plus airlines only making money when 85% of the seats are full, they do not have those late night flights to relocate aircraft and which flew at 50% or less capacity. That is for the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a NCAA D-3 college, yes. They love anyone who is athletic and wants to be part of the team. I saw a wide range of talent playing NCAA D-3 football in New England and at MIT. You would fit right in. However, in the NCAA D-1 The Ivy Athletic League, you would play on the Light-Weight football team. I don’t believe any other D-1 or D-2 leagues have light-weight football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To me a toddler is between the ages of 1 and 3. At 3 they become a pre-school child. We did Not want to lug car-seats with us when we flew with the boys to vacation in the Los Angeles area and Southern California from the Boston area a few times at that age, so they were fine as toddlers or older in the airplane seats with no car seat. Then I rented car seats from Hertz and the rental car. Easy. No muss and no fuss. And we could swap seats during the 5 to 6 hour flight without a lot of pain of moving the “car seat”. And, personally we did not and would not ever fly with a child under the age of 12 months old, Unless the flight/trip was specifically for the child so that removes infants from our equation. Enjoy the trip, if you have raised your children well, it will be a piece of cake. It was for us in our many flights with toddlers and young children. P.S. we highly recommend Southern California to vacation with young children from just north of LA to San Diego. Tons to do when the pandemic is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Besides the fact that they are fixated on the “Co” portion of the alphabet… Having grown-up in upstate New York, to attend Cornell you want be in the middle of nowhere and with a chance to experience the great outdoors by merely walking outside of your dorm. Snowshoes are not always optional….. Whereas to attend Columbia you Thirst for the big city and the bright lights that block out the stars at night. Simple. Oh, and you don’t get that Agricultural smell when the wind shifts at Columbia….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reflecting back, our youngest son, in 2002, was in fifth grade with 27 students in the class room. That was atypical for his school system, but worked fine. However, that was Average for me when I attended school. If break school into: K-2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12 then the average number of students in the classroom will Increase as those levels increase. 18 to 30 across that range. Enjoy school, it can be a Ton of Fun and should be very educational. Remember, after 4th grade, you Stop being taught and become a Learner using all of the resources around you including the teachers. But starting in 5th grade it is On You. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, it is expected (by the Federal, State and Local governments) that the parents will provide the First and the Bulk of the money that is expected to be paid for an undergraduate college education. Therefore, the parents are responsible for the child until the child completes the expected number of years of college to achieve that degree. They screw-up and take too long, that is on them. Otherwise, when they are eighteen years old And have graduated from high school (or were expelled or they dropped out), that is it. They are on their own. Simple. If you want to support them past 18 and after high school, make them have a Plan that you have to agree with. Super simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, as a coach, you Must work on the strength of of your weaker foot. Must. Second, it is up to the coach. There are times that I put that player with the great right-footed shot/cross on the right of the field. However, in some games, I switched that player to the left side, for that sudden quick right footed shot that the defenders and goal keeper were not expecting. Work on both feet, and work with your coach. It is a Team sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had Many hours of private conversations with my high school teachers and later with my college professors. That is what is expected of any student who truly wants to succeed. I don’t remember any major problems, but I pretty much shared all with them, and surprisingly, they shared a lot with me. And when I needed letters of recommendation for college or for a job, they asked me if they could submit them. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be treated just like the colleges have done this Spring: You should get a Credit for any food that you pre-paid for that was not consumed by your child because they are no longer at the private school, If it was a boarding school, you should receive Credit for any dorm room time not used, If it was a day-school, then you should receive a Credit for any pre-paid transportation that you paid the school to transport your child to/from school Any credit will be applied to next year’s invoices. If your child is a senior, then mid-Summer you would receive a check for any money remaining in your child’s bursars account. The school is still providing teachers and online instruction. Therefore there are No refunds nor credits for the tuition And note: If it was a day school and you paid directly for transportation daily to/from the school (not paid to the school), then that is a Huge savings. As any of us who are working from home know, we are saving a small fortune in commuting costs. Simple. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will assume you are an International student, applying to colleges in the USA, and to get a F-1 student visa you will need a certain amount of money in Cash in the bank for the first year, plus extra money for a round-trip ticket, plus sufficient liquidity to pay all expenses for the 2nd year and possibly more. Therefore, a letter is not enough. That person would have to Give you that money, with a signed contract to protect them, and that money would need to be in Your bank account or in your parents’ bank account. Enough cash to pay all expenses for the first year plus a round-trip ticket and the Promise of the same amount or more for future years. You only get one real chance at the interview with an US consulate staff member so make it perfect. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my personal opinion there are only Two ways to attend college for a graduate degree, like that Masters in Mechanical Engineering: You have been working very well for a few years and your company, through its employee benefit plan, Pays to let you get a masters degree part time at a near by good college. Therefore, you attend CMU or UIUC only if they are a convenient drive from where you live or work. That will be a masters without a thesis, because your company already knows how great you are with their projects, You want to get a Masters with a Thesis so you can either get a great job or continue on for a PhD. In that case, you find the research topic that is of interest for you, and the professor that is working in that niche area. It is possible that neither CMU nor UIUC has any ongoing research projects that are of interest to you and you would be better off looking at WPI or Purdue as examples. I assume you are in the second category, and since both UIUC and CMU are very good, you should head to the one that has the research of interest to you and of course is Fully-Funded so that you get free tuition and a generous stipend (for a single person) towards your living expenses. You also should consider, since you will move to a new area for two years, if there are jobs in your niche area near those colleges. That way you can get a job after getting your Masters without having to move again. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the course is available via the internet, then there must be a way for you to Pay and get access to that course. AP courses cost Money. US high schools pay big Money to get an AP course and its material. And, to take an AP test (prior to the Pandemic) it must be given at a school that Pays the College Board for that privilege. Then it would be up to you to find a location within your country Or travel to the USA at your own expense and find a school that will Allow you to take the test at their location. It is not a trivial process. And AP courses nor exams are that important. Their importance is highly exaggerated to make money for the company that provides them. MANY students at the top private universities in the USA took few or no AP classes. No one that I went to MIT with took any AP classes. We all looked down on those “teach to the test” classes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First it is FAFSA, and it is Not financial aid. FAFSA are the Free forms that you fill out online to request financial aid from the Federal Government, and most if not all colleges will not consider you for any financial aid, if you are an US applicant, unless you fill out those forms. As they want the Feds to provide the first batch of money. Federal Student Aid If you qualify for a Pell Grant and/or you select a Federal Direct Student Loan, that money ($6,200 max for Pell grant and $5,500 max for a loan freshman year) is sent directly to the college and will be used to first defray any tuition and fees that you owe the college, and then will go to pay for a college dorm room and a college meal plan. If you are living at home, then the college will determine what your expenses are and allocate any left-over Federally provided money to you for that. Work with your college’s bursars office. And, all of that is detailed in the letter for financial aid and overall cost to attend that the college will mail to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My understanding is that UCLA and all of the UC campuses only accept transfer students who will transfer in and become juniors.

<|startoftext|>You would have to be one of the best youth players in the UK. You should be on one of the UK national youth teams for basketball. An US college athletic scholarship is predominately for the NCAA D-1 players and they are some of the best in the world at basketball. For example, take a look at this male basketball player from Australia who plays for Stanford (not a power house in NCAA basketball): Isaac White - Men's Basketball - Stanford University Athletics Or be 7 feet 6 inches tall and a good overall athlete. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You forgot to mention the sport or sports that you play very well at a high level. To attend one of the US military academies you must be a high level physical specimen. Indeed, you are required to play a sport each of the three seasons at the Academies: Fall, Winter and Spring. Lacrosse is good, but football is even better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. While the MLS is the D-1 league for USA and Canada (combined) it is a joke on the international stage compared to the D-1 leagues in England, Germany, Spain and Italy. In those four countries, the MLS would be a high level D-3 league and a few teams might be able to survive in D-2. Indeed, many of the MLS all-stars are Retired players from the top leagues in Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>International student…… First to get a F-1 student visa, you must show the US consulate staff member who interviews you that you have the Cash (in the bank) required to pay everything that is listed on your I-20 form without working off-campus during the academic year. Period. And you must be considered a full-time student, per the college’s definition. To be a full-time masters student the college will require you to take 2 or typically at least 3 courses per term, while you are a Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant. NCAA soccer: Assuming you were never a Professional soccer player in your country, the NCAA allows you Five years from the moment you started taking college classes after graduating from high school, to play four seasons of a college sport. Therefore, if you attended four years of college to earn a bachelors degree, you would have one year of eligibility remaining. You would first convince the head varsity soccer coach that you would be a valuable addition to the college’s soccer team, and then you and the coach would speak with the college’s Athletic Director and the AD would seek approval for you to play soccer for that single Fall season. It can be done. MLS soccer: The only international players that are allowed into the MLS are D-1 professional players from other countries who are on loan to the MLS. So, it is almost impossible for you to be an international college student in the USA while being on a MLS team, if you are starting as a student. However, if you are a pro level soccer player in your country, you could get a visa that would allow you to play pro soccer in the USA. That would be a “full time” job from February through October. However, after your first season, your USL or MLS soccer team may allow you to take graduate level courses at a local good college. Most of the MLS teams are located close to some excellent US colleges. But in that case you would be a Pro soccer player who is allowed to be a part-time college student. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same way as for male high school athletes: Be one of the best in your sport in your state or region of your country. Find some US colleges of interest to you, go to the college’s athletics web site, and look over the rosters of the female athletes. You can see what they did in their sport prior to college and the same will be true for someone like you. Here is an example: https://www.gocrimson.com/landing/index (Harvard) and UCLA - Official Athletics Website<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I am going 350 miles or less, I only drive or take the bus. If I am going 350 to 500 miles I will consider driving and possibly fly if I can get into a convenient airport. Beyond 500 miles, that is easily more than a one-day drive one-way and I will fly. I have business in Dayton, OH that is about 800 miles away, and I will fly from Boston to Columbus, OH and then drive a rental car to my destination, because I can get direct flights to Columbus. I have business in Albuquerque, NM that is 2,200 miles away and I will fly from BOS to ABQ and always have an intermediate stop and 95% of the time I also have to change airplanes.

<|startoftext|>Simple: Read this How to Get a Work Permit In California Then go speak with the principal or headmaster of your private school. You are certainly not the first private school student who wanted to work. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, why? Helping others is Expected. However, helping someone cheat or do something illegal is not expected and not nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I have a 7 day per week, full year subscription to the Boston Globe which also gives me free access to the online version of the complete Boston Globe web site and archives. I also have a low-cost digital subscription to the Washington Post. I get news alerts also from the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. Essentially those are the only sources of news in the USA that I trust, and even then I am skeptical at first. I have to read a Paper edition of a newspaper to truly absorb the news. Although everything is online, I am doubtful that most people see all the articles. Whereas, in the paper version, it is easy to see and read everything. And it can be used to protect the floor when you polish your shoes, cover the bottom of a bird cage, or rolled-up and used to swat flying insects. Win-win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, if you are poor, then you should speak with your high school guidance counselor and you may be able to get a Fee Waiver and pay nothing to take the SAT SAT Fee Waivers However, if you are taking the SAT in a country outside of the USA, there are No fee waivers. In that case, you can get a part-time job and earn some money. Good luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure. And if you don’t you can be “marked down” for being absent and also possibly marked down for poor class participation. Put on some clothing or find a quiet place in your home and Just Do It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is amazing what is on the World Wide Web Do I Need to File a Tax Return? I guess the IRS anticipated your question and built an online tool Years ago…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably not. You should have immediately filed your 2019 tax forms as soon as the stimulus was announced. Mine are relatively complicated and it took me all of one day to do. You don’t have to pay any tax due until July but you could have filed immediately. Now you wait until 2021 and hope they allow you to claim it. NOTE: Anyone who got a stimulus check in 2020, may have that amount Deducted from any Tax Credits they are allowed when they file in April 2021. The money is not a gift, it is merely a tax credit in advance. Of course, tax credits don’t go negative, so anyone who doesn’t normally get a tax credit won’t have to “return the stimulus” money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would they? It is up to you to file your Schedule C correctly and honestly and keep detailed track of all receipts and expenditures through the course of the business year. Indeed, I merely use an Excel workbook to keep track of my Schedule C, self-employed side-business and I actually hate it when colleges or leagues send me a 1099. I already have every single check and cash transaction recorded. Just do the same. Easy.<|endoftext|>

Through school and college, part-time jobs during the academic year or during the summer help you develop your work ethic and ability to work well with a wide variety of different people. Clubs and organizations and sports (in school or in the local extended community) help the person Expand as a person.

<|startoftext|>Most of the elite Private US colleges have two pools of freshman applicants: US: citizens, permanent residents and legal refugees International Many also have a self-imposed Quota on the number of international freshman applicants who will enroll in the college each year (usually between 8% and 16% of those enrolled). That usually drops the acceptance rate for international freshman applicants to one-third of the overall rate. Applicants are judged by the Pool that they are in. Applicants are Not compared within any one school. However, all of those colleges have an extensive database on every school system world wide from which anyone has ever applied to the college, whether they were accepted, and if accepted did they attend, and if they attended did they graduate. Statistical data with no identifying info to determine the actual person. So, you will be judged on your being in the entire International applicant pool and the JHU admissions staff will look at the many year statistics on your high school that they may have. It is a very extensive Holistic process. Good luck. Get The Facts | Undergraduate Admissions | Johns Hopkins University 14% international undergraduate students.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You can be assured of only two things if a college puts you on the Wait List: The college believes in you and believes they want you as a student and as a great fit with their undergraduate community, and would have accepted you but ran out of slots, The wait list is not weighted. There is No #1, 2, 3, etc on the wait list. Indeed any college “worth its salt” will use the wait list to meet some subtle diversity goal they may have for that academic year, Maybe another female or male or under-represented minority. Or maybe they need another good water polo player, or tuba player or drama major etc. You have No control over that. And they do Not need any more proof of your academic prowess, as they are assured that you are more than academically qualified for the college. Period. So you pray and wait. That is all you can, Except you MUST accept some other college first and pay that nonrefundable deposit. There are No guarantees that anyone will be accepted from a wait list. Indeed every college Hopes that they Never have to use the wait list. Period. Good luck, whether you play water polo or the tuba or are a major lead actor…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every child is allowed to attend the public school in which district the student lives. However, for many reasons, especially in the suburbs, a parent may want the child to attend the public school in an neighboring district where the parent may work. If you petition the principal of that school and get the permission of the superintendent of the school district and get to/from the school on your own, then many school districts will allow that on a space available basis. However, some school districts will charge a nominal annual fee. We have a neighbor who is a teacher at a neighboring school district. His daughter was allowed to attend that neighboring school district for many years. No big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was a player: Outside defense or Goal Keeper. As a goal keeper is merely a defender with his brains beat out……. And as a defender you learn the mantra: “The ball can get by me or the opponent can get by me, but Never both…” Great sport…. Interesting side note: I had stopped playing and was completely focused on high level refereeing when our sons were born. They were one year apart and played on many of the same soccer teams. I was an outside left back and………………….. They each ended up as starting outside left back…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Physical activity: Sports or Dance or Horseback Riding (depending on the school), etc. All of the private boarding schools that I am familiar with Require every student participate in a physical activity (or be a sport manager) in each season (Fall, Winter and Spring). That is in addition to orchestra or drama etc. Mind and Body: It is difficult to improve one without improving the other. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Once we had our finances in order and had sufficient money for emergencies, then I did the Catch-Up with my company’s 401K that allowed me to contribute $25,000 of my earnings in addition to the company’s match. And that is pre-tax money!!! Of course, I was working long enough that I had a full Pension, and therefore the 401K was “gravy”. If you have a full pension, then just put in the minimum amount in the 401K to get the match from your company, until you have your finances in order and have a six month emergency money in a bank account. However, if you are new to the industry and do Not have a pension, then you Must put at least 10% of your gross earnings into your 401K, and that is “your pension”. Anything above that amount is discretionary (after finances are in order), but the first 10% is Mandatory if you have no pension. Our sons followed that advice when they started their first jobs out of college in 2013 and 2014 and are doing Fine. Indeed, if you have a decent career, any Social Security money that you receive after age 62 (preferably at age 70) is Gravy. All the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For Profit colleges merely want your Money. Period. That is why they are For Profit. Their return policy is “Buyer Beware”. If you send them money, you might as well “kiss that cash goodbye”. Stick to the normal Non-profit real colleges in the USA, or beware….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh? What is it that you are trying to prove? The Space Shuttle was a NASA operated space vehicle and was designed under NASA specifications and NASA was responsible for the launch and flight of the vehicle. However, when a NASA employee rents a car from Hertz on a business trip, the employee is Not driving a government vehicle. Similarly, NASA has specifications for Commercial spacecraft that NASA will allow its employees to use. Therefore, the SpaceX Dragon capsule and the Boeing Starliner capsule are both commercial vehicles that are licensed for operation by the FAA. SpaceX or Boeing is responsible for the launch of those capsules and those are licensed commercial launches and Not a NASA launch. Therefore, the NASA astronaut controlling the Dragon or Starliner capsule is “driving a commercial rental vehicle”, just like the Hertz rental car they drove from the hotel to the launch complex. Simple. While the Orion is a NASA funded capsule that will be nominally launched by NASA on the NASA SLS. An astronaut in control of the Orion would be operating a NASA vehicle and therefore there is no FAA license required for the Orion nor the SLS nor the launch nor the reentry. Super Simple.

<|startoftext|>No. why? If the child is properly restrained in the seat, and if you can show that the passenger supplemental restraint (airbag) is turned off or that the passenger seat is all the way back in its setting (for a non-infant), then the front seat is perfectly fine for a child of any age and certainly fine for a toddler or older. The image shows that a passenger airbag is truly supplemental and would never even touch a properly restrained child with the passenger seat all the way back. Easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have driven to New York City several times for a vacation. Typically, as soon as we arrive, we park the car in a near-by parking garage (Manhattan), pay upwards of $45 per day, and never use the car again until the day we are leaving NYC. When we vacationed in Brooklyn we lucked out. We checked into our hotel on a Monday at 1 pm and street cleaning on that street was each Monday from 9 am to 11 am. Therefore, we lucked into a parking space on the street and left the car parked near the hotel, on the street for five days and never paid a cent. However, most of the time, we now take a GoBus from Boston area to near the Penn Station in Manhattan and take the subway everywhere we go combined with walking. Far less expensive. Fundamentally, once in NYC park your car immediately and do Not use it again until you leave NYC. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here is the link for everyone: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/teenweb/permit_btn1/permit In general I agree with it. However, once the person has a Drivers License (not a permit), I believe, if the new driver is under the age of 18, that if they are driving Directly to/from school, that they may have a sibling under the age of 18 who attends that school in the car with them. That takes care of the issues with a family with a child who is a senior, and two siblings who are a freshman and a sophomore and they could ride to/from school with the senior driving, but can’t due to the age limit. That One exception should be revisited. Maybe get a sign-off by the school principal since they have to park at or near the school anyway…… Otherwise it is fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rank, schmank….. The elite private US colleges look at: Your complete transcript, everything The mandatory letter of recommendation from your high school guidance counselor or headmaster that describes you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person. That letter must accompany the official transcript and the secondary school report that describes (in detail) the types of courses offered, the levels of those courses, the grading philosophy, the types of colleges to which previous students from that school have attended, etc. etc. etc. At least two letters of recommendation submitted on your behalf by teachers who know you very well and whom you ask to write those letters Supplemental letters of recommendation from independent (from you) adults who know you well as a person and submit those letters either to the college or to your guidance counselor for inclusion in that letter of recommendation And required standardized test scores With all of that, no college needs a GPA nor a Rank for you. Indeed, all of that material will provide an Overall “rank” for you compared to everyone who has ever graduated from that high school over the many years. And those recommendations had better be Glowing Hot. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am used to seeing one of those. So, the other one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To become an aeronautical and astronautical engineer, at a top program like MIT (for example), you need an Excellent foundation from high school: Four years of science and every year and every concept is important because it assists with your technical critical thinking Four years of mathematics as mathematics is the language of engineering Several years of literature and history because that increases your level of overall critical thinking and assists you in your writing and communication skills A few years of a foreign language as all industry is International. Indeed, every NASA astronaut has to learn to communicate in Russian…. It is all important, including that biology course, and you will be surprised how that assists you during your four years of engineering to earn a bachelors degree. Enjoy it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The elite private US colleges do Not even look at the applications (regular or early) until at least several days or even a whole week After the deadline. No looking….. So, if you submit your application 30 seconds prior to the deadline it will be looked at in the same group as people who submitted their applications 30 days prior to the deadline. HOWEVER: It means EVERYTHING being submitted. When you “push that button” and submit your online application and payment that is but roughly 40% of the application. There also are: Official transcript, Letter of recommendation mandated from your high school guidance counselor or headmaster, Secondary school report that must be submitted by the counselor or headmaster, Letters of recommendation from two teachers that you select, Any supplemental letters of recommendation, Interview report (if an interview is offered), Any required standardized test scores. Your application is not complete until All of that is received by those elite Private colleges. Therefore, Yes, if you get All of your application submitted By the deadline (all of it), then the colleges Love you from the moment they start reading your application, because you are an Organized person who is great at Time Management. Consider all of that and good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, the many elite private US colleges accept a Lot of international students, as long as they are Graduate students. Here is MIT’s statistics: MIT | International Students Office 10% of the 4,500 undergraduate students are International and 41% of the 7,000 graduate students are international and most of those are Fully-Funded for their research and teaching work. Most if not all of the elite Private US colleges have a self-imposed Quota on international of Undergraduate students of between 8% and 12% of the undergraduate student community. All of these colleges are not-for-profit businesses and they are all Tax Exempt by the Federal, state and local governments. Therefore, to be in a Positive light by the many US citizens and Tax Payers, those colleges instituted that self-imposed Quota. Whereas, the many large state Public colleges (UCLA, Berkeley, UVA, Michigan, Texas, etc) mandate that 67% to 80% of their undergraduate students be US citizens and residents of their state…. And of course, the public colleges provide little to no financial aid for international undergraduate students and treat them instead as Cash Cows. Indeed a few years ago, there were one million international college students (undergraduate and graduate student) in the USA and pumping more than $30 Billion of foreign currency into the US economy each and every year. Thank You. So, get a bachelors degree in your country, be one of the best in your department and then become a fully-funded graduate student at a top US research university. Easy. And look at the University of Cambridge in England: Information for applicants from United States of America only 94 of the over 12,000 undergraduate students are from the USA. Countries are supposed to take care of their own Undergraduate students first. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for recognizing that it is The Ivy Athletic League. That is worth “points” in the admission process. There is a self-imposed Quota on international undergraduate students at all of those eight colleges and at most if not all of the elite Private US colleges. Therefore, if you are asking for No financial aid (zip, zero, nothing) then an international applicant’s overall chances of admission are one-third the published rate. And if you ask for any financial aid (other than at Harvard, Princeton or Yale) that will be held against you by the other five colleges who are all Need-Aware for international freshman applicants. Since you are a captain, what sport do you play at a high level (regional all-star in Australia)? Ivy League Check out the sports that are played by those Ivy League colleges at the NCAA D-1 level and if you are competitive, and a head varsity coach recruits you, then your chances of admission will jump to about 80%. They all love excellent athletes. If you can get recruited for Soccer or Basketball or even better American Tackle Football then you are In. Otherwise that great GPA, excellent SAT scores and the essay only amount to about 25% of the process of being admitted. A requirement but Insufficient. To be admitted you have to convince one of those eight colleges that you will be an excellent fit for the college’s undergraduate community Outside of the classroom. Read this article, the links and the full report (one of the links) as those eight colleges participated in writing the report along with MIT and 70 other colleges. Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And you will need Glowing Hot letters of recommendation submitted on your behalf. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really???? So if you live in Poughkeepsie NY, as a high school student, (as an example) you are going to Move to live in a hotel or a bed & breakfast near a NASA facility???? Really??? And if you live near a NASA facility, then most high school rising juniors or seniors would get GoFer jobs. Go for this and go for that, that their parents got them. There is a rule of thumb in the aerospace industry: Summer Help and Some are not. And most people who are younger than a rising junior in college are Not. It is not worth the time and the energy to have children (high school students) hanging around. And even rising college sophomores barely have a better foundation than a high school graduate. Life is Who do you know and What do you know? Who do you know that is willing to contact NASA and possibly embarrass themselves by recommending that a Child be interviewed for a summer job? And what do you know that will convince a NASA engineer that you are worth the effort, as a Child, to have working at a government facility for the summer? However, if you live within a short walk or bicycle or bus ride of a NASA facility check with your family and friends’ families and high school science/math teachers and see if any one of those is willing to contact someone that they know at NASA on your behalf.

And between the two doors, there was a machine that accepted your quarters and you could buy a life insurance policy for that flight. And there was a full and nice toilet area and a sandwich shop. But typically you walked in 20 minutes prior to the flight leaving and walked directly onto your “Slow-Hawk” flight (Mohawk Airlines). Heaven!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t understand the question for the USA. You book the tickets. When you buy the tickets you specify where you want to sit. Then You can get your boarding pass 24 hours ahead of the flight. If there is problem with the boarding passes then you will immediately call the airline. You are expected to clear the TSA security line and arrive at your boarding gate at Least 45 minutes prior to the scheduled flight time. Since You are the one responsible, why would the airline do anything different??? Of course if You book the flight too close to flight time and have to get the seat assignment at the boarding gate, then arrive Really early. And if You screw up and arrive at the gate late in the boarding process and the airline can barely squeeze you and your child onto the flight then You are dependent upon being courteous to the boarding agent and the flight attendants and They will do their absolute best to assist you. Of course, if your “child” is older than 11, then who cares……. But essentially it is Not the airline, but You.<|endoftext|>

And with the current pandemic (April 2020) it is doubtful for the summer of 2020. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Filling Out the FAFSA® Form Federal Student Aid Simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For what purpose? Why can’t you have the PayPal account and when your teenager actually needs something they can ask you to pay via PayPal. Maybe once per month at most. On the other hand, how is your child going to Fund their own PayPal account? With your credit card info? Then No. Make it your account. Be a Parent and not a buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Med School interviews are (when there is no pandemic) face-to-face. Yes, mention the leadership skills you have developed as a barista and how well you work with a wide variety of people. That is something that doctors must be able to do. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assuming your are asking about NCAA Bowl Championship football, then that could easily be Boston College’s stadium which they had to expand to met the minimum requirements for the NCAA D-1 Bowl Championship colleges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be easy. They wouldn’t “suddenly” become YouTubers. They had to have a job in the summers after junior and senior years of high school. They would be YouTubing then as a job and seeing what they can accomplish and they would continue doing that during senior year of high school. Once they get the “rhythm” down, they would have a balance between being a YouTuber and a student. Therefore, they would continue that during college. Simple Easy and Effective. They could major in business, acting, drama, theater, music, computer science, etc. etc etc. Whatever they believe would assist them in their YouTube career. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a saying among soccer referees: “Touchy touchy is OK. Pushy Pushy is not”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did for me. I did a Co-Op in the 2nd term of my junior year at MIT from February thru August. I was able to graduate in four academic years, and only needed to take one course during the summer and I did that at branch of Syracuse University that was not too far from where I lived and worked in the summer. I was paid a starting engineer salary, that more than covered the cost of my minor tuition that I paid to MIT for the “Co-Op credits”, and all of my living expenses and the cost of driving round trip from Boston area to Los Angeles for the Co-Op. And I had money left over to assist with paying for first term senior year, and I got a bonus (I was paid for unused vacation time) that following February of my senior year….. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. That would be for the second tier Public colleges in your state. Enjoy college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Battle??? Bedtime????????????????????????

<|startoftext|>AP classes are meaningless. Merely show the colleges that you have challenged yourself academically during high school. That could be extra projects that you did in different courses. Get letters of recommendation from the teachers and have it noted in your transcript and in the mandatory letter of recommendation that your high school guidance counselor (or head master) must send along with your transcript. Extracurricular activities are ANYTHING that you do with other people outside of the classroom and many times outside of the school: Jobs, church work, playing sports, dancing, etc. etc etc. If all you do is study and class work you will never be an undergraduate at one of those elite Private US colleges. You could, however, at a later date become a fully-funded graduate student at an elite research university. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, in order to be in a Masters program, you have to have taken the undergraduate prerequisite courses to prepare you for the Masters courses. It is not clear to me that being a Materials Engineer will provide you with the same computer science foundation that someone with a bachelors in computer science or computer engineering would have. Therefore, doubtful that you could “transfer” masters programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For everyone’s info: Since ~1982, I have never received a payment from the IRS for over paying my taxes during the year. Even though I am an employee of a company, I always make an additional quarterly payment and then make a 5th payment by April 15th for the previous year. That way, I pay the Federal government and I am not dependent upon the IRS sending me a check. Period. Everyone should do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. If you are claimed as a dependent on your parents’ Federal income tax return, then you do Not receive a stimulus payment direct to you. If you were 16 or younger on Dec 31st, 2019 then your parents would get an extra $500 in their stimulus payment from the IRS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I tend to use the wording: “need based financial aid” I save the word scholarship for an award for merit or for athletic prowess independent of need. Most if not all international undergraduate student applicants will be required, along with all of their parents, to fill out the daunting CSS Profile forms each year and then the college has a trusted independent agency in your country verify the content of your application. Apply for College Financial Aid – CSS Profile – The College Board Additionally, only five US colleges are Need-Blind for admissions. That means that the vast majority are Need-Aware for undergraduate admissions and will hold asking for any financial aid against you during the admission process. However, a large number will provide up to and including full financial aid if they admit you. Whereas, roughly 40% of the graduate students in the USA working on Research are international students and they are Fully-Funded as graduate students. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Best? For a beginner? Read this and other articles and if you are spending much more than $30 (may $40) on a soccer ball you are spending too much as a beginner. Soccer Ball 101 | SOCCER.COM As for soccer shoes….. You have to try them on. For many years I could only wear Adidas soccer cleats back when the shoe leather was Kangaroo skin. However with the advent of more FieldTurf fields, one should consider a very good turf shoe as well. Find a brand that fits Your feet very well and feels comfortable In the Store. Do NOT order online. Buy in the store and then you can order more of the same (immediately) online, but as a beginner you won’t need that many that soon. Buy one pair for a grass field (cleats) and one pair for a FieldTurf field. As many of us referees have aged, most of us have transitioned to Trail Running shoes for both types of fields when we referee. But we all still have a good pair of cleats for those wet-grass/dirt/mud days…. As a beginner, try not to spend more than $80 (maybe $90) on a pair of soccer shoes. As for those really expensive shoes, wait until you are a pro and the shoe manufacturers Pay You to wear those expensive shoes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a basis, in the 1980’s the MIT varsity men’s soccer coach expected that every returning player would demonstrate running a mile in 6 minutes on the first day of practice. A NCAA D-3 program with no expectations of anyone going pro. I played NCAA D-3 soccer with an all New England 100 and 400 meter high hurdle champion. Defending against him was nearly impossible. I can easily see every D-1 professional soccer player easily running a mile in 5 minutes or less. Heck, as a D-3 college player and also a college soccer referee, I easily ran the 400 meters in under 60 seconds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The elite private US colleges are some of the best in the World and most if not all of them have a self-imposed Quota on international undergraduate students (no Quotas on international Graduate students). That quota varies from 8% to 12% of the undergraduate student community. And therefore, take the published overall acceptance rate for those colleges and Divide by Three to arrive at a good estimate of the acceptance rate for international freshman applicants. However, you are guaranteed of not being accepted at any of those 20+ universities (the eight of The Ivy Athletic League, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, NESCAC league, some Patriot league, UAA league etc.) if you never apply. Look at those ~20 excellent private US colleges and find 2 or 3 that would be a great fit for You. Then apply to that short list and apply to at least one of those early. And also apply to very good colleges in your country and in other countries (don’t forget Canada and Europe). Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No. However, if later you earn a MD-PhD program from Harvard and MIT, then you are expected to. The overall admission rate to Harvard is less than 6%.

<|startoftext|>Actually it is possible for those to be different. My experience is with MIT.

Enjoy your college education and your experience on campus, post-pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most if not all of the elite private US colleges have a self-imposed quota on international undergraduate students. That drives down the chance of admission.

<|startoftext|>Women’s college soccer played under the NCAA rules is the Same as for men: A player is allowed to enter the first half Once A player is allowed to enter the second half twice A player is allowed to enter an overtime period Once There are exceptions for goal keepers (as long as the they leave the game as a goal keeper and reenter as a goal keeper) There are exceptions if a player needs to be check under a concussion protocol or if a player is bleeding. That player may be replaced and then reenter that same period and that does not count against the restrictions noted above. We NISOA referees who officiate the NCAA soccer games are well versed on all of the particulars of the college substitution rules.

<|startoftext|>Sounds like they saved a Ton of money by not having to send you to a private boarding school for thirteen years (since they obviously didn’t want you around). That saved them close to a million dollars. See if they will give you half of that now (and they made much more than that half in investment gain over the years). That will pay for college or pay-off any loans and give you a down payment on a house. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some might say “your Soul” However, in the greater Boston area the tuition at the large St John’s Prep School is $24,000 per year, and the tuition at the much smaller Matignon high school is $12,500 per year. Those are day schools. NOTE: There are Catholic day schools that cost over $40,000 per year. But figure on at least $18,000 per year and you should be OK for financial planning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, and Parents should Not own a 529 plan. Here is the catch: a 529 plan is included in the CSS Profile assets of the parents and therefore will contribute to the Expected Family Contribution However, anyone can give any one else $15,000 per year tax free and not-recorded anywhere Therefore, two parents can give at least $30,000 to one set of grandparents per year. If you trust your parents/in-laws, then they put the money into a 529 plan for your child. Then they disburse the money to your child starting in April of their junior year in college. By that point your child already has filed for financial aid for senior year and the money showing up will not affect their financial aid award. Then the child uses the 529 money from the grandparents to pay the amount due (after college provided financial aid) to the college, and uses the remainder to pay off the Student Loans very rapidly once they have received their bachelors degree…. Sneaky, and legal as far as I know, as long as you trust the grandparents…… Do NOT disburse any 529 money to the child before junior year otherwise the college will figure it out and greatly reduce any financial aid……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can give you a definitive answer for “from 1969” Annual tuition (for the complete academic year): 1969–70 school year for MIT: $2,150 and the minimum wage was $1.60 Big Mac + Fries + Soda was $1 2019–2020 school year for MIT: $53,790 and the minimum wage is ~$12.75/hr Tuition and Financial Aid Big Mac + Fries + Soda is $6 So, the cost of a McDonald’s lunch went up by a factor of 6. The minimum wage has gone up (depending upon the area) by a factor of ~8. Whereas the cost of tuition for a top private college has increased by a factor of 25. The inflation factor from 1969 to 2019 is: 7 . So with an inflation factor of 7, the rise in the price of a meal at McDonald’s and the rise in the minimum wage seem correct. It is the triple rate of the tuition that is out of line. HOWEVER, most of that occurred from 1980 to 1990, where the top 30 to 40 private colleges in the USA (including MIT, Harvard, etc.) met at Wellesley College each Spring and: Set the starting salaries of Assistant professors Set the cost of tuition Compared notes on who was admitting whom and adjusted financial aid Therefore, for at least ten years, there was total collusion among the top colleges in the USA and the remaining colleges merely followed suit. Congress finally acted and merely slapped the wrists of those top colleges (the members of Congress were alumni……) and told them, “don’t do that any more”. So the astronomical rise in tuition from 1969 to 1990 was slowed, but never went down. Enjoy capitalism mixed with a little socialism and welcome to the big Business of US colleges which are Tax-Exempt yet many of the elite private colleges have an endowment that is larger than the GNP of many small countries…….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are three types of taxes in the USA: Federal State Local One thing that is common with each of them is the Certainty of death and taxes. We, the people, are the government. If you are a citizen of the USA and an adult, you get to vote on the government in your local town (local area) including the school board, vote on your state legislators, and also vote on your representatives to Congress (the House and the Senate) and vote for your state’s electors who choose the President and Vice-President of the USA. Those three levels of government set the taxes that you then pay. Simple. Taxes pay for all government provided things in your local area Taxes pay for the operation of your state. And taxes pay for the operation and security of the United States of America. I emphasize the word states, in that the USA is unique in that the country is a collection of states, and most laws that affect the citizens are local and state laws.<|endoftext|>

If you think that Binghamton is the big city, then you need to get out in the world more. Drexel has a wonderful Co-Op system in which you take four years of courses and pay four years of tuition over a five year period and during that period it is interspersed with three six-month paying Co-Op jobs that are related to your major. Drexel is close to the major transportation hub in Philadelphia and across the street from UPenn. Unless cost is a major factor (and don’t forget to include the money you earn in those 18 months of paying Co-Op jobs) I would head to Drexel. You can still maintain your friendship with people back in little-town upstate NY. I did that and still do that. You even have the internet and can still go home during vacations.

<|startoftext|>In the USA, in every college program that I know of, you must have a bachelors degree in order to be admitted to a Masters degree program. And your bachelors degree must include any prerequisite undergraduate courses for taking the graduate courses in your Masters discipline. However, if your bachelors degree does not cover all of the prerequisite courses, some universities will allow you to register for one or two terms as a Special Student to take those prerequisite courses with Zero financial aid for those courses.

<|startoftext|>There are eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League That is the only Ivy league that exists. Each of those very old elite Private colleges has an overall similar philosophy in academics and in athletics and all share the same Mantra: Mind and Body: It is difficult to improve one without improving the other. They play in the NCAA D-1 league but offer No (zero) academic nor athletic scholarships. They do however all offer up to and including full financial aid after the students and their parents fill out the FAFSA forms (if they are US) and everyone fills out the CSS Profile forms each year. Roughly 16% of the undergraduate students at those colleges (possibly higher) will play an intercollegiate sport. The overall admission rate for all of those colleges is less than 10% however, the admission rate for recruited varsity athletes is in excess of 80%. One can visit all eight of those colleges in one one-week trip to the Northeast of the USA and is encouraged to do so, so the student can determine their perceived fit with the campus, the climate, the surrounding area, the overall activities that are available on and near campus, and their fit with the current peer undergraduate students. Cornell and Dartmouth are relatively isolated and in cold and snow areas. Students there should relish being outdoors in the Winter. Harvard, UPenn, Brown and Columbia are urban colleges and are surrounded by robust urban areas and are very close to major transportation centers. Yale and Princeton tend to be in smaller more suburban-like areas. Someone who will feel at home at Harvard or Columbia will probably not be a good fit with Cornell or Dartmouth. Really, those colleges are looking for great people who will fit in well with the campus, undergraduate student community and the overall surrounding area. Read this article, the links and the report as that report was written by all of those colleges plus over 70 more to tell people what they are seeking: Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions So, meet the guidelines of that report, be an excellent student and convince the college that You are a good fit with the college and vice-versa. NOTE: Assume that 16% of the admitted students will be recruited varsity athletes. And assume that 9% will be legacy only (some legacy will be recruited athletes). Therefore, for someone who is not a recruited athlete nor legacy, they are competing for only 75% (or less) of the available slots. Also, apply Early to at least one of those colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe, and maybe not. In a perfect world, all of the US colleges (public and private) would welcome a huge diverse set of applicants and then based upon their academic prowess combined with their Personal qualities, be admitted to the colleges. However, “trouble makers”, “rabble rousers”, and those that require a lot of care and attention, cost the colleges a lot of money. Universities Lose money on undergraduate students. Universities make their money on their graduate students who conduct lucrative research. So if you are not in a Protected status, and they believe you are more “costly” than others (and what will those letters of recommendation state from your guidance counselor and teachers…..) then some may not find you as the type of person they want on campus. The physically handicapped are more than welcomed and will always be provided for by all US colleges. Period. Yet, LGBTQ+ is not a physical handicap nor a mental disability. Indeed, in 2017, MIT had a dormitory (my old dorm) that was Loaded with a large collection of LGBTQ+ students who “just had a different way of being a student”. Finally, MIT got fed-up with their costly antics and Banished the Dorm. Gone, poof. Converted into a Graduate student only living residence with a new name and new address……………. No relationship to the oldest undergraduate dorm on campus. And we alumni are rather incensed that our place of remembrance was “destroyed” by a rabble-rousing group of disgruntled students……. So. Every college, once you are admitted, will go out of their way to provide you with whatever you need, within reason. You will have the full attention of professors and staff members. You will have full access to wonderful medical and mental-health facilities. Period. But, since the top colleges admit less than 10% of the applicants (less than One out of Ten), and they do Not have to tell you why you were rejected…… Do your homework. Have long polite discussions with your guidance counselor and stick to the questions that the colleges’ admissions staff ask as “essay prompts”. But do Not give the admission staff any inkling that you may be one of those trouble makers who will cost everyone a lot of money and time……………. I am trying to be realistic. You should be as well. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not important at all, indeed it is typically ignored by the elite Private colleges that accept students from around the world.

<|startoftext|>Sorry, but anyone who is a junior in high school and who plays a Spring sport (and Lacrosse is a Spring sport in most of the USA), is at a huge disadvantage for being recruited to play in college. They have no Spring season as a junior and college admissions are Given prior to the start of the Spring season as a high school senior. They can not even take a Post-Grad year at an elite private boarding school to highlight their lacrosse prowess because that season is after college admissions are made. And since you did not have an immaculate newsworthy sophomore year season, your only hope is to get admitted to a mid-level D-1 college and just wow-the-coaches at a pre-season walk-on try-out and getting invited to that walk-on try-out as a high school super-star as a senior. However, that means no athletic financial aid as a freshman. Good luck. You may want to aim at merely playing lacrosse for a good NCAA D-3 college like MIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who are admitted to those elite private US universities do Not ask how.

<|startoftext|>If you go to the Federal government Student Aid web pages and find the information on the free forms that you fill out (FAFSA forms), there is a list of colleges that the Federal government will consider for student aid to you (as the money is sent directly to the college and not to you). Some Canadian universities are on that list and I believe a few in the UK. However, most of the time, if you go to a foreign university, given the many hundreds of fine universities within the USA, you are completely on your own. On the other hand, if you are attending an US university and do a term or an academic year of exchange to a foreign university through your US university, any Federal student loan money that you receive will still flow through the US university which will support your studies at an international university. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Coding in and off itself, is not really considered an extracurricular activity, Unless you are volunteering at a charity to assist them in their work by the coding that you do.

<|startoftext|>It depends on the individual fit. For example, one of our sons wanted to major in Mechanical Engineering, and in April of his senior year he had acceptances from Drexel, WPI and University of Delaware. By chance in 2009 when he was making his decision they were ranked (Mech Eng) 49,50, and 51 and I can’t remember in which order. However, his dream college, just from walking the campus and getting a feel for the students and the area, etc. was U Delaware which had 17,500 undergraduate students versus WPI which was STEM oriented with 4,700 undergraduate students or about a quarter the size. However, to him, U Delaware had roughly the same sized mechanical engineering department as WPI, but it had a much larger diversity of overall students and things to do and get excited about. So, he was much happier at UDel and therefore did better as a student. Find Your fit. NOTE: UDel is an out-of-state college for us from Massachusetts. And he personally did not like the “feel” of Drexel for him, where as I know a lot of engineers who loved Drexel….. Find your fit….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Years ago I was on the MIT student government (Undergraduate Association) as a representative. This was 1970–72 and we spent more time arguing discussing the Vietnam War than with anything substantial for MIT. Of course, MIT was “part of the war machine”, etc etc etc. I stopped being a representative, because the whole thing was a waste of time. Yes, there are probably issues that need to be brought before the college administration, and the Student Body President can do that. At MIT, back then, the president lead protests and sit-ins in the president’s office and then was “expelled” from MIT (brought back quietly several years later to finish his degree). So, if you are a political science or international relations major, you probably want to run for student government and then for student body president for your resume. For most others, it is a waste of time. For example at my engineering job, we do what we need to do and obey what the company senior leadership states. Period. The same with a college. The students need to do their thing (study), stay out of trouble and graduate. Period. Don’t waste your time with student government unless you need it for your resume and/or you Really think you can be effective in doing something to assist the other students. For example, for many years at MIT I was on the Intramural sport council assisting in creating and running sports for students and then on the Athletic Board as the graduate student representative, assisting in community sports activities for everyone on campus. At least there I was useful to the other students. Student Government? Generally ineffective and a waste of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I (and many others) have answered this before, and Quora should have shown you those answers…. Succinctly: Currently, the number of freshmen entering college in the USA is decreasing and many smaller private colleges have closed or merged with other colleges over the last several years. Those elite Private US colleges (MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc) have been the same size for Undergraduate students for Many years (certainly since the 1960’s). They have a limited amount of land available to them and do Not wish to spend more money expanding their undergraduate student facilities. They believe they Have to provide dormitory space for all undergraduate students, and Certainly for all freshmen, Undergraduate students Lose money for MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc as they are large Research universities. When I attended MIT in the early 1970’s there were 4,200 undergraduate students and about 3,500 graduate students. Now there are 4,500 undergraduate students (a couple of new dorms were built and there is no more room for them) and slightly more than 7,000 graduate students. Graduate students work on Research and they assist MIT in Making Money. Undergraduate students take the professors and staff away from their research and they cost the universities a Lot of money. Indeed, if the college is charging $55,000 per year in tuition, then the tuition should be $110,000 per year to pay for all of the “stuff” that is required for the undergraduate students. However the endowment plus the income from the research takes care of the excess. So, succinctly: Undergraduate students Lose Money for the colleges, and they do Not want to use any more land/money to increase the number of undergraduate students. They want to use that land and money to build more research facilities and Make More Money with the Graduate students who mostly live off-campus on their own. Simple.<|endoftext|>

They were called Routes back then and for example Route 1 went down the East coast from Maine to Florida and Interstate 95 essentially parallels Route 1. However, East to West it was more a collection of roads to get from Boston to Seattle instead of Interstate 90. Routes are numbered from East to West and Interstate Highways from West to East that run North-South (Interstate 5 is along the West Coast for example compared to Route 1 along the East coast) Similarly, East-West Routes are numbered from North to South, while interstate high ways that are East-West are numbered from South to North to avoid confusion. Enjoy your drive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is considered a nickname or shortened form of Elizabeth. And the same will be for your daughter, as people will assume her proper name is Elizabeth. And if you name her Elizabeth, there is no guarantee that any of her friends will call her Beth. They may call her Liz or Lizard-Breath…. Be careful what you select for a name for your child as you Do Not control the nickname that your child will have for Life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot of videos on YouTube of people on weird swing sets going “over the top” On the playground at my elementary school, the swings had the top cross-bar about ten feet off the ground. It was routine for some of the boys to be able to swing (chains were used to attach the swing to the cross bar) and go Over the Top, or be 20 feet in the air and upside down. Routine. Not for me, but for many on our playground. Then the janitors would have to come with ladders to “unravel” the chains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A STEM college student will spend 60 to 65 hours per week in class, studying, and doing homework and projects. Enjoy the experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two criteria for that: The college student is Not listed as a dependent on their family’s Federal tax return for 2018 or 2019 They have a social security number and filed a Federal tax return in 2018 or 2019 Both must be true in order to get a stimulus check for $1,200.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before there is any financial aid of any type, plan on: $5,000 per year to live at home and commute to a local community college $25,000 per year to live on-campus at a Public college in your state $45,000 per year to live on-campus at a Public college in another state $75,000 per year to attend a private college Some will cost more, some less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again you are Directed to University & College Search Tool where you will find this: San Diego State University and if you look at that web site it will tell you that there are 5,275 freshmen enrolled each year and for that 69,842 applied and 23,767 were admitted for a Yield of 22.2% which is rather low.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What does the properties that your family owns have to do with your Leaving Canada after finishing your college studies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Admission to a large Public university that requires you to declare a major on your freshman application? Yes. Admission to an elite Private US college like Harvard or MIT or Stanford, etc. which merely admits students and then lets them choose which ever major they want just prior to sophomore year in college and let’s then change majors as a junior? No. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The stimulus is for the Family. You, as a dependent of your family, (listed on your family’s Federal Income Tax return) want the $500 sent to your Family for you. However, your family, assisting you in paying for your college tuition, already get a $2,500 reduction in the income tax that they owe to the Federal government. In most cases, $2,500 is more than $500….. And thank your parents for providing More than half of your cost of living for the last year. Whereas, if you are Not listed as a dependent on their Federal tax return for 2018 and 2019, and filed a Federal tax return for 2018 or 2019, then you will get a check for $1,200. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First at some point you need to enter the real world and be on your own, However you may wish to ease into that. Therefore you can: Live at home and attend a local community college for two years, commuting to the college and then, after two years and with some pre-planning automatically become a junior at the top public university system in your state. Of course, it is most likely you would then need to be on your own living your junior and senior years of college near that public university Or be lucky enough to live within a convenient commute of a good four year university. For example if you lived in Cambridge, MA and are lucky enough to be admitted to MIT or Harvard, you are allowed to live with your parents and commute to the college. But at some point, you will need to Spread your wings and fly on your own…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The key in your question is Public high school. As an international student whose family lives in another country, you can, at Most, spend one year as an exchange student at an US public high school. However, if your guardianship is transferred to a family member (non-parent) who lives in the USA, then you can move in with them and attend the public high school in that district (where your new guardian lives). Or, if your family (parents) relocate to the USA on a non-tourist visa, then you can move with them and attend the public high school in district in which your parents now live. Whereas you can attend a Private boarding school for many years on a F-1 student visa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clubs? No. Sports, possibly. If our company needs some softball or soccer or ice hockey players for our company team, then that is a bonus!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did the same thing. We hid them behind our garage and then use them every year when our neighborhood has a block party. Also those long orange wooden barriers are great as well: Make certain your son helps with using those cones and barriers for your neighborhood block parties. He should assist in setting them up properly and then taking them down and storing them safely for the next block party. Works great for us. Enjoy the neighborhood camaraderie and thank your son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you have a steady job that seems secure? Do you have a cash reserve of six months expenses? And in addition, can you put down 50% of the cost of the car and finance the rest over 24 months? If yes, then go for it. If not, then wait until after the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. All we wanted were healthy babies, and being 39 and 40 years old when they were born, we stopped after two healthy babies. Two sons 15 months apart worked out Wonderfully. We even gave them different last names so they could have plausible deniability, but they have always worked well together and still do. And we believe it would have been the same with two daughters or a boy and a girl. On my wife’s side of the family our two sons are part of 9 first-cousins: four boys and five girls, and they all get along wonderfully and are constantly doing things together. (My side of the family is relatively remote from us). The way a family should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether you are attending an online college or enrolled in a “brick-and-mortar” college and merely online the remainder of this Spring’s term due to the pandemic you: Contact (e-mail) your faculty adviser and the main office of your department. You arrange to Withdraw and not “drop-out” as most colleges will allow you to return in one or several years, In that process you will be told to login to your account with the Bursar’s office and make certain it goes to Zero Pay anything you owe Or if you have a credit, get a check from the Bursar’s Office Your e-mail and probably telephone conversation with your department’s main office and with your faculty adviser should remove you from owing anything for the next academic term Simple. E-mail versus face-to-face. All of those critical staff members are working either on-campus or remotely and checking e-mail each day. Make certain you include a phone number where they can reach you as I am certain your faculty adviser will want to call you and speak with you by phone. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When our sons completed college and started their first real full-time jobs (2013 and 2014), I told them to place a Minimum of 10% of their gross salary into their company’s 401K account, and hopefully their company would match a portion of that. I told them, that first 10% is equivalent to the pension that I receive. And that anything above 10% (including the company match) is their “IRA/real-401K” like mine. They have followed that advice, and are doing well. I would offer the same advice to your daughter, except it is not clear from your question of whether she is working full-time (40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year) or not. If she is working full-time, and she is working for a company that does not have a 401K plan for the employees, then she needs to check the US Federal tax laws, but I would believe she should open a traditional IRA and do the same as I recommended to my sons- deposit 10% of her Gross salary into that 401K. That is pre-tax money and she is then leveraging the “Government’s money” for those many years….. However, my sons had starting salaries of slightly more than $60,000 per year coming out of college with bachelors degrees, and therefore they could afford to pay-off their $25,000 (each) in student loans within 5 years, rent an apartment, get a nice used car or public transit card, and live reasonably and still deposit that 10% each month. And they were told to save to have a 6 month cushion in their bank account and then to continue to save for at least a 10% down payment on some future house (if not 20%). And not to have children until they have no real debt and have a minimum of that 6 month cushion and preferably a house. I offer the same advice for your daughter. But first she needs to take care of basics. Complete whatever education she needs (certificate or associates degree or more) and be able to pay rent, utilities and food and pay all credit card debt in Full each and every month. She needs to get by those basics before trying to save for retirement which is 50 years in the future or more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our sons started young (3 or 4 years old) but Not with soccer balls. Instead those light play balls that are 8 inches in diameter. When those are in the air, the boys learned to chest trap and head the ball properly to bring the ball under control and do something useful with it. Knowing that, then outdoors the players from age 5 to 8 will play really small sided games where heading the ball is not part of the game as the ball should not be that high off the floor/ground. Typically by the time they are 12 years old, and playing 8v8 soccer, then the coaches can work with them to properly head the #4 sized ball. By that point they should have sufficient foot and body skills with the ball to not be clumsy and get hurt trying to head the ball. Then at 13 years old they will be playing 11v11 with a #5 ball and doing all of the drills and skills of any soccer player, including heading. However, with a really light play-ball, 3 years old is great to get them used to the multi-dimensions of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are a student at one of the eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League, then there are Lots of opportunities to volunteer to assist people in the local region. However, if you are not a student or staff member at one of those eight colleges, and can pass a drug test and a back-ground test, then you may be able to volunteer at any of those many athletic events as a parking lot staff member or an usher in the stadiums. Enjoy the events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably the Canadian Football League. The Big 4 will be the Big 4 for many more years. The MLS is bringing Division 2 and Division 3 soccer to the USA and not what the US fans crave which would be the equivalent of the English Premier league or the D-1 leagues in Germany, Spain or Italy. The USA fans will not get too overly excited about retired European soccer players in the MLS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the large public US universities will welcome you with open arms if you are a good student And have $300,000 USD in cash to pay for all expenses related to your four years of study in the USA. And thank you for your injection of that money into the US economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know there have been people who hiked/walked from the West Coast to the East Coast and vice-versa, typically for some fund-raiser or “political”-statement. However, I don’t have a good reference at this moment. I do believe there was this fellow called Forest Gump who ran from coast to coast….. NOTE: I f you are planning on doing this, be VERY careful for the climate/weather/terrain from the West coast through the Rocky mountains and especially the Southern deserts. Once you are East of Denver, it is a stroll in the park….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh? Summer after freshman year at MIT, by dad got me a job as a junior engineer at NY State DOT. Summer after sophomore year at MIT a friend got me a job as a aluminum window and screen repairer and installer. Second term junior year (Feb-Aug) one of my professors got me a Co-Op job in an aerospace company in Los Angeles. Three summer jobs, about a day of work each to get them. Indeed the Co-Op job took about an hour. Life is Who do you know? and What do you know? Who I knew got me those three great job considerations. What I knew got me the job. Simple and should take almost no time at all. So? Who do You know? And start with professors, department chairpersons, college job placement office, family and friends. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If along with that excellent resume you have $85,000 is spare cash to spend each year (total cost) to attend NYU Stern from India, then you have an excellent change of admission.

<|startoftext|>Unfortunately about 12 years ago, MIT demoted 8 of its 40 varsity sports to club status for reasons that somehow befuddled most of the alumni, let alone the D-3 student athletes. Men’s wrestling (a top team in New England) was one of the eight. MIT Wrestling However, there is a way for all of the club sports teams that are primarily for undergraduate students to submit a short list of freshman applicants that the club fully believes could greatly help the team. That list is sent through the Department of Athletics (just like any head varsity coach’s list) to the Admissions staff. And since the MIT Dean of Admissions was a MIT varsity athlete and then a head varsity coach at one point in his career, that list will have a little influence as it shows the admissions staff that truly that applicant is believed to be able to assist the undergraduate community outside of the classroom. Additionally, there is a mechanism for the other (non-sport) clubs/activities to send a short list to the admissions staff. Good luck. And I know that Erland would approve: Erland Van Lidth De Jeude - Wikipedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of our sons spent the second term of his junior year in college at the University of Melbourne (the one in Australia….) January thru June of 2013. We were assisting him in attending his US college, Villanova. His Villanova tuition paid for the tuition in Australia, and he did not need a dorm at Villanova. He got a local apartment near U Melbourne and we made certain that his bank account had enough money to pay for food. I paid for his apartment as I did for his Villanova dorm, online. Simple. The only real difference was the $3,000 in air travel expenses for the round-trip, but Villanova gave him a $1,500 scholarship for that and he worked over the previous summer and earned enough money for the rest. Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your question is flawed. If Harvard believes after reviewing your family’s submittal of the FAFSA forms and the CSS Profile forms that your family can afford to pay $35,000 per year to attend Harvard (EFC or expected family contribution), then your family can afford to pay that with No (Zero) loans taken out by you. Period. If your parents require you to take out some loans (I required mine to take out $25,000 total each several years ago) that is for character building. One would assume that you applied to Harvard because you Truly want to attend Harvard and you see that there is an excellent fit between you and Harvard. Given that, then head to the Crimson and thank your family for the financial assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be prepared to go to the hospital with your child. It is a right of passage for all youth. It is how they learn their limits.

<|startoftext|>I like them both. However, I prefer the St Louis Blues to the Atlanta Flames.

<|startoftext|>I hate to inform you, But: None of the eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League provide merit scholarships nor athletic scholarships. None. However, the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League, along with many of the elite private US universities (like Stanford, MIT, Caltech, etc.) will provide up to and including full Financial Aid, based upon the information that you and all of your parents submit through the CSS Profile forms and which are verified by an independent agency in your country that is trusted by the college: Apply for College Financial Aid – CSS Profile – The College Board However, only MIT, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Amherst College are Need-Blind for the admission of international freshman applicants. All of the other US colleges will hold asking for any financial aid against you during the admissions process. That will drop to the admission probability at Stanford or Caltech to almost nil….. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Academic scholarships? Maybe after you have been at Rutgers for one full academic year and have impressed a professor in your department. It is probably easier to go here: Rutgers University Athletics - Official Athletics Website and find a team that needs your talents and get a partial athletic scholarship (Rutgers is towards the bottom of their league and can use all the help you can bring), Or do well with a professor and get an on-campus research job.

Then, if you are doing well and worked closely with your faculty adviser, you can be in a guaranteed program to become a junior at your state’s top Public university system. Continue to do well there, while transitioning to living away from home, and then you can become a fully-funded graduate student at a top research university. Simple yet effective. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For every US university that I am familiar with: A PhD in Civil Engineering is Free.

<|startoftext|>Two things that will assist you in getting admitted: * Are your parents Wealthy and Powerful? * Do you play a sport (played at Exeter) very well? If not, and if you need any financial aid, then forget Exeter as an international student.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an undergraduate student, you will do Fine at either one. The biggest factor will be Your fit with the college.

<|startoftext|>Forget transferring. Transferring to an elite Private college like Cornell is tougher than getting admitted as a freshman from high school. And, Cornell will look for reasons for the transfer, and since NYU Tandon is an excellent engineering program, you will drop to the bottom of the list and can almost be guaranteed to waste your time in trying fruitlessly to transfer. However, if you can get two professors and the head of your engineering department at NYU Tandon to support your transfer to Cornell and if they know professors at Cornell’s Engineering School than you may have a chance…… Stick it out at NYU Tandon and then become a fully-funded graduate student at Cornell after earning your bachelors degree at Tandon. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Taking a gap year Before applying to colleges is “Stupid” (my personal belief). Many colleges have an Early application of Nov 1st and most have an application deadline of January 1st. You want to Not apply and merely nerd through your senior year of high school. Then you graduate in June and start your Gap year….. Really??? It is Not a whole year. ….Early application of Nov 1st and most have an application deadline of January 1st….. So, within a few months of graduating high school, you have to start applying to colleges. Yet many of the US colleges want a mandatory letter of recommendation from your guidance counselor or headmaster, and recommendations from two teachers. However, you are No Longer a student at that school and why should they be bothered helping you when they need to help the current seniors???? Instead you “blew them off” the previous year, claiming you were not going to apply to colleges but would take a Gap year to prove yourself, but what have you done from June through October?????? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best and encouraged gap year is to apply to colleges as a senior in high school, get admitted and enroll in one college. Then ask the college to grant you a Year Off to explore some topic and start college a year later. That is a True gap year. Granted if your high school ends in January rather than June, then you may need to modify that process. But get into college, ask for a one year delay in starting at that college, and then enjoy a true Gap Year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No. Once you are rejected as a freshman applicant, the college does Not want to hear from you again for the remainder of that year. Many colleges have too big of a wait list anyway, and they don’t need anyone else on it. However, come June, do some “Googling” for colleges that are still seeking students, and you may be surprised of the length of the list and which colleges are on the list. If the college you want to attend is on the list, then call them immediately in June. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are many places around the USA, where you can become a room mate in a shared house/apartment and $1,000 per month will pay your share of the rent and utilities, and the left-over money will pay for your modest food for the month. Therefore, $4,000 should get you at least three months in a shared living situation. Then you need to be working 40 hours per week at $12.50 per hour (at a minimum) and that will get you $500 per week before taxes. With that, you can survive on your own in a shared living environment. DO NOT run up a large credit card balance. Pay any credit card bill In Full, each and every month. In the example above, try to SAVE $200 per month, each and every month, And pay off any credit card bill in full each and every month. Shop for furniture at a Good Will store. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I believe In Massachusetts, Salem State University is part of the tier-2 levels of public colleges in the state and here are their minimum admissions requirements (GPA and SAT) First-Year Admission Requirements You will note that they believe an 1170 to be a high score. And that score. along with decent transcript could get you into many states’ top Public university system. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You wear what you would normally wear on a day to day basis. For many years, as both an engineer and as a soccer referee, I wore: a typical “nerdy” digital watch. But then about a dozen years ago, I wanted something simple and yet nice: and then my company bestowed this watch on me and I wear it all the time (except when refereeing, when I switch back to the digital watch): It is nice, extremely accurate and simple. So, earlier in life, it was the digital, then simple yet nice analog watches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my high school, that was the Chemistry teacher (1968) However, with the major advancements in biology, chemistry is now required before biology, and now in most US high schools, the chemistry teacher works with the sophomores (10th grade) and the Biology teacher teaches science to the juniors (11th grade). Enjoy all of your high school courses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Private schools: Don’t take those who need special help Get rid of anyone who is a poor student Therefore, if you are remaining as a student at a private school, you will get a better education because you will be with a better set of peer-students. Similarly with Public exam schools. If you can get rid of the Chaff, then the wheat gets a bit better…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not considering cost, then you Must consider location and fit with you as an Individual. For me, having grown up in upstate NY and know all about the isolation and the Winters at Cornell, I would attend Cornell as it is Great and would “feel like home”. Also, UCLA is a piece of heaven on Earth. Whereas, you may prefer Atlanta and Emory. I, personally, would only attend UC Berkeley as a fully-funded Graduate student, but not as an undergraduate. So, find Your best fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent question. Assuming your parents did Not live in California for at least One year prior to your starting classes at UCI, then you will need to pay Out-of-state tuition. However, midway through the Fall semester, go and sit down (face-to-face) with a person in the UC Irvine’s Bursars’ office and discuss this with them. Bring proof of where your parents are then living and where they are working. It is likely that starting as a sophomore you will be allowed to pay in-state tuition. Don’t accept No as an answer, but be polite and be persistent, until all of the published rules show you can’t do it. But, I believe you can for sophomore year and beyond. Go Anteaters!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go back to the college from which you received your BA. Discuss all of this with the Dean of Students’ office and see if you can work out a plan where you can return to that college, and work on a different Bachelors degree. Do NOT start to lie to colleges. Honesty is always the best policy. There will be a path forward for you. And if you don’t want to attend that same four-year college again, then check with the Public colleges in your state. For example, in Massachusetts, I would check first with the UMass system, and then with the The Nine State Universities of Massachusetts. There are a total of 13 campuses around Massachusetts and each one will consider your request if you are a resident of Massachusetts. (As an example). Check in your state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ignoring the current COVID-19 pandemic…………….. NYU Tandon is located in Brooklyn and near Many companies that really need computer scientists. I would think that you could get a Masters degree and a job nicely at NYU Tandon, then at Penn State out in the “boonies” of Pennsylvania. Both are very good graduate school programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, I believe that very few if any college freshmen need a car while they are at campus. They should Not be shuttling home each weekend. They should integrate into the college campus and regional area community. Plus a car is expensive, and college is expensive enough. However, if your child needs a car, then from my experience it should be compact on the outside and “voluminous” on the inside. Therefore easy to maneuver in traffic and to park, but can also carry everything you need to carry. This car will work like a champ: Honda Fit. It is economical to buy and to operate. It is small and nimble, and yet my niece was able (using the hatchback) to load and transport a Kayak inside her Fit. The rear seats fold down and you can load a lot of stuff inside when heading to college in the Fall and returning from college in the late Spring. It is front-wheel drive. However, if the person will be in the Snow Belt, then look at a small AWD Subaru which is a bit more expensive. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give the person your Federal supplemental check for $1,200. They probably will not have a job for a long time and can use the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA there is the NCAA and the NAIA for intercollegiate sports and a National Junior college group for the community college sports. The NCAA has D-1, D-2, and D-3. The highest the NAIA has is the equivalent to the NCAA D-2. For the NCAA, more than Half of the total NCAA athletes are in D-3. There are No athletic scholarships, ZERO, at the NCAA D-3 level. Read this web site: College Athletic Scholarship Limits That summarizes all of the scholarships that are allowed per sport, per college. A “head count sport” means that every single player gets a Full Athletic Scholarship (a “full ride” in your lingo). There are only two for males and four for women. However, for most of the NCAA D-1 colleges, men’s and women’s ice hockey is almost a head count sport and I believe the best players are getting a “full ride”. What the web site shows are the number of Equivalent full scholarships that may be given collectively to everyone on the team (except for the head count sports). For example, men’s soccer has 9.9 equivalent scholarships. But if the team carries 23 players, then the 9.9 gets divided-up among the 23 players….. There is a small percentage of college athletes that get a Full-Ride. Many merely get a little financial assistance in the way of a partial athletic scholarship. MOST get Zero, nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Huh??? Because of the COVID-19 virus pandemic, most students are not in school but at home and communicating with the school via the internet. Discipline? If the student who is online does something egregious, then the easiest discipline is to Flunk the student. Simple and easy….. Without sufficient credits to graduate, the student must spend another Year in school…… Or some summer…… Discipline is swift and brutal, when classes are online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is April of 2020 so I will assume you will be a high school senior in some US state from September 2020 to June 2021, and will try to start college in the USA in late August or September of 2021. As long as your parents are residents of that state for that time frame (July 2020 through August 2021), you will be considered an in-state student for any Public college in your state. If you are an Excellent student, one of the top five percent in your state, there are Many scholarships that will reduce the cost of attending the top state public college in your state to almost nothing. When you register with your local public high school where you will be living in the USA, speak at length with your high school guidance counselor. This is one of many topics you will need to discuss. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

I would head to the out skirts of Philadelphia and attend Villanova.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on the college. Many colleges require 120 credits to graduate. MIT however requires 360 credits minimum to graduate, and I had 450 after four years. {Different credits…..} For those colleges that require 120 credits to graduate then one earns 15 credits in a half-academic year (one term or semester).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indeed, in Massachusetts we have 19 sports spread over three sport seasons (Fall, Winter, and Spring): Home - MIAA Home Page and across over 300 high schools. and there are some “informal” sports played among several schools (rowing, sailing, rugby, ultimate Frisbee, etc.) There is a philosophy that was started by Cambridge and Oxford universities in England and came to the USA and have been adopted by most if not all of the elite Private US colleges, like the eight in The Ivy Athletic League: Mind and Body: You should improve one in order to improve the other. And it is a wonderful interactive way to get physical exercise, mental stimulation and improve your team work with others. All high schools, world wide, should follow the lead of Cambridge and Oxford in England……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All admissions to every college are conditional. There is a condition that you: Pay a non-refundable deposit Complete your high school education and graduate Get above some minimum grade in all “major courses” in your senior year Remain a “good person” and do not get suspended/expelled from high school and/or do not get arrested for doing anything illegal If you screw-up in one of those areas, you admission will be Revoked. Good luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should start by exploring the Public university system in your state. For example, in Massachusetts where I live, we have three levels of public colleges: UMass System: Campus Finder which is at the top with four campuses Massachusetts State University system: The Nine State Universities of Massachusetts. More widely dispersed around the state and may have niche majors that fit your interests Fifteen community colleges around the state to meet everyone’s needs: Massachusetts Community Colleges All states will be “similar” typically with a three tier system If your education foundation is a bit rusty than you may wish to enroll in a local community college in your state under a Guarantee of being able to transfer to your state’s top public university system as a junior after two years. In Massachusetts that is the MassTransfer | UMass Amherst which allows someone to start at one of the fifteen local community colleges and then become a junior at the top state University. Check with your state. If you do the community college to University path, you can remain where you currently live and go to school half-time while working half-to-full time and then take the last two years to be resident near the public university campus. I am certain one can do that in five to six years, total. Or in 4 years straight through and working 16 to 20 hours per week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Global rating??????????? Please………………………………….. Attend the college that is the best fit for You in order to earn a bachelors degree: The best college in the world could be the worst college for you if you are a bad fit with the overall-college and area. Period. Be one of the best students in your department and then become a fully-funded graduate student at one of the world’s finest research institutes that has research related to your niche interests. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay full tuition. The colleges (most if not all) are providing refunds for unused “meal tickets” and a partial refund for college provided housing. And some colleges assisted (with money) to get students home or to a safe location. The cost of the professor’s time is the same, and the colleges are spending money to provide real-time online content as well as recorded content. A good college student should do just fine. Less whining and more studying and researching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, RPI is going to be better than Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for mechanical engineering, indeed all engineering. RPI is a Doctoral level university and Cal Poly mostly stops at the Masters level (at least in aerospace engineering). HOWEVER: Almost everyone who I know who attended RPI loved the education but could not wait to get away from the Troy, NY area. I grew up in the upstate NY region and would not want to attend RPI except as a last resort. Whereas, I know several people who attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Loved the education and thoroughly loved the campus and the whole region in San Luis Obispo. And if you are Not used to Winters that are cold with a lot of snow and last more than half of the academic year, then forget RPI and head West to San Luis Obispo. You can always become a fully-funded PhD student at RPI…. (most of my friends stayed at San Luis Obispo and became fully funded Masters students). Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can’t. Indeed, many (most) of the elite private US colleges do Not have majors for freshmen. One takes a wide-range of foundation courses as a freshman and then selects a major before the start of sophomore year at college and many will still change their major by the start of junior year. And they mostly all graduate in four years. Enjoy the exploration of your future and try to attend an elite private US college that has the range of majors you could be interested in so that all you have to do is transfer departments and not transfer colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple Convince your parents to move your family to Germany where you can attend high school while playing with local amateur clubs. As you rise through the club program, you will garner the attention of the pro teams. You will start at a D-3 pro level and work your way up. If your family is not into German, then try England or Italy. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is always a chance. First, there are eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League and you need to find the 2 to 4 that are a good fit for You. All eight are Not a good fit for any one person, so do your homework. Additionally, there are many similar elite Private US colleges like: MIT, Stanford, Caltech, Duke, Amherst College, Williams College, etc. Besides The Ivy Athletic League which plays all of its sports at the NCAA D-1 level, check out the smaller NESCAC conference colleges (Amherst, Williams, etc.) and the UAA conference colleges (NYU, Brandeis, U Washington of St Louis, U Chicago, etc) that all play NCAA D-3 level sports and the Patriot League (Bucknell, Leigh, etc) that also play NCAA D-1 sports. You may be better applying to some of the NESCAC or MIT or UAA colleges if you would like to try and play an intercollegiate sport. In my dorm at MIT, it seemed everyone played an instrument or sang at a very high level (there are pianos every where, many guitars and our dorm won the amateur talent contest two of the four years I was there). That is routine, and did not factor into the students being admitted. You will need Excellent letters of recommendation from: Your guidance counselor or head master who must write a letter that describes you over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person. What will that letter say? Two teachers that you select who will expound on your academic prowess and also comment on you as a Person who works well with others, At least one or two (maybe three) supplemental letters of recommendation from club advisers, or employers or team coaches, etc., who are independent (from you) adults who can be trusted by the colleges to provide unbiased recommendations of you as a Person and how you work well with others and assist others 25% of being admitted to an elite Private US college is having excellent academic prowess. Required but Insufficient. I believe that: 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character (read the article, the links and the report): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions All of those colleges got together several years ago to write that report to tell people like you what the colleges are looking for in successful freshman applicants. And don’t forget those Glowing Hot letters of recommendation. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, less than 10% of high school varsity athletes will be on a college varsity team in that sport. Less than 1% at an NCAA D-1 college program. To even get a college (D-3) interested in you, you must be a Starter for your high school team (or local high level amateur team). Being a school or league All Star will assist you at the D-3 level. If you are a regional or state All-Star now the D-2 and some D-1 colleges will start to notice. The D-1 programs are typically seeking athletes who are state or higher high school all-stars And are playing on very high level amateur teams in the the “other seasons”. Most if not all colleges have an athletic web site and on that site is a list of the current teams and the team rosters. Check out the biographies of the current college athletes at the colleges of interest to you. See what they did when they were your age. There are also the biographies and contact info for the coaches. And there is usually a “Recruit Me” type of link so that you can fill out a form to provide info to the coaching staff. I attended MIT where I played soccer and ice hockey on the intercollegiate level. Here is the link to the athletic site and you can see what I am indicating, and that is for a NCAA D-3 program that is middle of the pack in many sports and very good in a few. https://www.mitathletics.com/landing/index Check out the biographies of athletes in your sport to see what D-3 athletes did at your age…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exchange…. You will attend a college in your country or in a neighboring country , that has an exchange program with an US college. Then you will either spend freshman year in the US or junior year in the US.

<|startoftext|>See Boeing 2707 - Wikipedia It wasn’t just the Sonic Boom that killed the commercial development of a SST (the Concorde was funded by the French and UK governments) it was the scare of the SSTs depleting the Earth’s ozone layer. I was an aero-astro student back then and took a seminar on the Concorde, the 2707 and also the Space Shuttle in the Spring of 1973. And I had a chance to tour the Concorde when it visited Boston (through a MIT conducted tour). The solution is flying slower (Mach 1.5 instead of 2) and with a changed fuselage arrangement, Or flying Much faster and much Higher. The most economical one, will be Faster and Higher from the perspective of the passengers. The Concorde was doomed from the start, because it hardly reduced the overall door-to-door time from Paris to USA, and when flying from Paris to the USA (against the wind) it had to declare a low Fuel emergency many times. It was propped-up by France and England for “industrial glory”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the last ten years or so, everyone that I know who went to medical school after earning a bachelors degree took a one to two year gap, worked at a medically-related job, studied for the MCAT and took the MCAT and then went on an around-the-USA campaign of interviewing (face-to-face) with medical schools. You do Not apply to medical school. You mount a Campaign. And yes, take a gap year including a Paying medically related job as that is part of the medical school admission consideration.

<|startoftext|>From my experience with many sports, I believe you are discussing international or professional soccer players playing under FIFA Laws of the Game. Of the eleven players who start the game, only three substitutes are allowed and no one can reenter the game. And there are no time outs. Therefore, those soccer players “Fake Injuries” to get a time out. Simple. With the new VAR (Video Assistant Referee) those fakers will not be drawing cautions nor dismissals against the opponent. When was the last time you saw a water polo player faking an injury and stretcher bearers jumping into the pool? Enjoy the sports.<|endoftext|>

In general, $4,000 is a bit more than $500. So be careful what you wish for, or the Federal government may grant your wish and take away the $4,000 reduction in Federal taxes (and this is Every year for up to four years and not just a single time……) Stop worrying, relax and smell the roses…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The form? You could complete that in less than 24 hours. However, there are other things like (for MIT) getting your guidance counselor to write a letter of recommendation and submit your official transcript to the college, for you to get at least two teachers to write letters of recommendation and submit them on your behalf to the colleges, and to take any required standardized tests. The basic application is easy and trivial, if you are a reasonable writer and have an excellent command of the English language. Those “pesky” application essays, are Not essays, but merely Answers to the questions that the colleges’ admissions staff have asked you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First you need to have filed a 2018 Federal tax return, and if not, then you had better submit your 2019 Federal tax return ASAP, and if you owe any money, then you have until July 15th to pay. If you are a college student on a full scholarship and work some small jobs in the Summer to pay for your summer residence away from your parents and home, then you may Not have submitted any Federal tax returns. But if you have submitted a 2018 and/or a 2019 Federal tax return, and your SS# is Not on your parents Federal tax return as a dependent (better double check), then Yes, you should get a stimulus check.

<|startoftext|>Weight is merely a way to measure the mass of an object on the surface of the Earth for a nearly constant gravitational acceleration. Since force is merely mass times the local acceleration, Then one only needs to apply a known force to that object and measure the acceleration of the object to determine its mass. I do Not know how an astronaut at the International Space Station measures their current mass during the duration of their stay on the space station. However, if I was to make a measurement device, I would look for something that could apply a known force to the astronaut and measure the initial acceleration (time rate change in distance moved per second). So, how do they “weigh” astronauts and cosmonauts on the Space Station?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Personally, I do not believe that tennis, golf nor bowling should be Olympic sports. Those are individual sports that have way too many meets/events per year, and another at the Olympics is meaningless. The Summer Olympics is already overloaded with too many athletes, and to allow any new sport, it requires a competition for a men’s event and a women’s event. Curling is in the Winter Olympics and that is a team sport that is not seen very much world-wide when not at the Olympics. Therefore that is different. Bowling is on TV all the time. In high school (upstate NY) we used to follow our favorite professional bowlers on TV and try to find one that we could emulate in style. No. Bowling should not be an Olympic sport and golf and tennis should be eliminated from the Olympics.<|endoftext|>

If no one drops out, and any normal amount of Michigan community college students are brought in, then you will have no opportunity to be admitted. However, if there are still openings after a reasonable number of Michigan residents from Michigan community colleges are accepted, and you require Zero financial aid, therefore you have at least $70,000 to pay Total costs for an out-of -state student to attend U Michigan per year, then you have an excellent chance. All public universities go after OOS students either as recruited athletes or Cash Cows. Decide which of the two you are, and promote that in your U Michigan application. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t expect anything to approach normal for sporting events until the 2021 Olympics and later. It is unlikely that there will be a wide-spread vaccine available until April 2021 and then it will take time to vaccinate the Entire World, and to convince the anti-vax people to comply. The first large batches of vaccine will go to medical personnel, first-responders, and then the elderly in nursing homes and group settings. It will take many months to get the vaccine to the general population who would make up the majority of spectators at professional and college sports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Across the UC system, roughly 92% of the accepted transfer students come from California Community colleges. If you attend either CSULB or CSUF you will be exposed to very good academic preparation in biology or any of the STEM fields.

Transfer admission guarantee (TAG) NOTE: Caltech will accept transfer in for sophomore year, but there are so Few that it is meaningless to consider. Additionally, I believe even the Cal State system expects transfers to have completed two years of academic preparation: Transfer | CSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far, the COVID-19 virus for children under the age of 9, has a death rate that is similar to Measles: 0.1% https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf And when the measles vaccine was approved in 1963, I was 12 years old and we all had measles and stayed out of school for two weeks and studied at home. No big deal. It is likely that the COVID-19 virus will be like the measles virus. However, the measles had been around for Hundreds of years so older people had developed an immunity by having the virus as children. The issue is that the COVID-19 virus is killing the older patients at a very high rate. Once a vaccine is found, it will become like measles, except for those Stupid anti-vax people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Undergraduate students, by and large, are members of their family. The stimulus checks go to the Family, if the college student is listed as a dependent on the family’s Federal tax return. So a family with a 15 year old high school student and a 19 year old college sophomore will get (typically) $2,900 in a single stimulus check. $1,200 for each parent and $500 for each dependent that is Less than 17 years old on 12/31/2019. They do Not get the extra $500 for the college student. HOWEVER, the family gets up to $4,000 reduction in the taxes that they pay by contributing to the tuition of that college: Is college tuition tax deductible? Yes, you can reduce your taxable income by up to $4,000 And $4,000 in cash is generally larger than $500. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to think of Catholic schools getting students from many different areas within the region, and they will be a large mix of students from wealthy families and poor families.

I worked Every summer full time. I refereed/umpired intramural sports and made over two-times the minimum wage with a flexible hour job (sign-up each week). I also had a seven month paying Co-Op job my second term junior year (Feb-Aug) at an aircraft company in Los Angeles and that paid for my apartment and all expenses and I saved enough to pay for half of my senior year. My high school job part-time at McDonald’s paid for all of my freshman year. As a graduate student at MIT, I was fully-funded.

Even the Catholic colleges in the Big East Conference and Notre Dame do not have that many religious requirements. It seems that Liberty University does, and that is generally out-of-step with an US education for adults.

<|startoftext|>I will assume you are writing a novel and are trying to determine a semi-realistic scenario. First start with looking at the F-35A or F-35C public data: Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II - Wikipedia You will note that the F-35A and the F-35C both have almost a 700 nm combat radius. Then look at a map of the world: Beijing and you will see the surrounding area and it is “obvious” that for an initial feasibility let us assume a F-35A originating from Seoul Korea Great Circle Mapper And you will see that it is about a 500 nm flight one way. Therefore a F-35A based in South Korea or an F-35C from an aircraft carrier near South Korea could make the round-trip with a combat payload. It is possible that a single F-35 or maybe a pair of F-35 jets could fly at subsonic speeds at just above tree-top level, make it to Beijing and release their payload. However, it is doubtful that the F-35 would make it out of China. I would consider that mission a Suicide mission. It is possible in a non-conflict scenario, the Chinese air-defense sites would have a false-positive threshold that may allow the F-35 to penetrate to Beijing. However, once the payload is delivered, then the false positive threshold would be lowered and and Chinese AWACS would be on High alert with aerial interceptors launched and others on high alert. So, if you like a one-way flight, go for it in your story. Maybe have the pilot(s) bail out and attempt to “walk” out, Chuck Yeager style. Good luck with a publisher.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Simple. Be highly recruited by a head varsity coach from either UCLA or UC Irvine. Go Bruins or Go Anteaters. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No wait list is binding. Indeed, you could enroll in any US college, pay your non-refundable deposit, and then decide to not attend that college and enroll in a different college or none at all. But you lose your non-refundable deposit. If you think that you May attend UPenn if asked to enroll from the wait list, then stay on the wait list. And those colleges do Not expect you to withdraw from the wait list until just before May 1st, as they will not even look to admit from the wait list until Mid-May or later. Think it over. But if you believe you might attend UPenn if asked from the wait list, then remain on the wait list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are not interested in anything related to a career??? Nothing at all??? For example, MIT has no majors for freshmen. A MIT student selects a major before the start of sophomore year. However, MIT will ask you what you are interested in doing in college in the application process. Colleges only want students who are a good fit with the college. If you don’t know what you want to do at all, then why that college??? And the college will assume you are a poor fit. Sit down with your guidance counselor, with some trusted teachers, and with your parents and discuss your interests and your long term goals at this stage of your life. Maybe you want to be a fire-fighter or a major league baseball umpire…. While also working as an astrophysicist. You could do two or all three of those during your life. Just be honest with yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you wish to apply Early Action to MIT, MIT has No Restrictions: EXCEPT: MIT expects you to obey and follow all restrictions that any other college, to which you apply Early Decision or Restricted Early Action, requires. Early Action, in itself, comes with no restrictions at any college. If it does, then it is a Restricted Early Action program. If you apply Early Action to MIT and apply Early Decision to another college that requires you to Not apply early to any other private college, then MIT will find out (they have their ways) and will defer you to the regular admission pool and will note your unethical behavior. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are admitted to a college, then by filling out the FAFSA forms in April, you will be qualified to receive Pell Grant money (if your family is economically challenged) and you will be able to borrow from the Federal Direct Student loan program ($5,500 maximum as a freshman, and that goes up in later years). However, you are too late to get any money from most colleges. Therefore, any college money awarded as a grant for financial aid will not be available to you at most if not all US colleges.

<|startoftext|>Why??? Are you getting Full Financial Aid from University of Rochester??? …students who accept the offer of admission should submit a non-refundable enrollment deposit of $800.00. The deposit is deducted from the fist tuition bill after the start of classes… You are merely pre-paying a little of what you owe to attend U Rochester. Now you know what your parents can do with $800 of the $2,400 in stimulus money (at a minimum) that your family will be receiving. Use a credit card and then pay the credit card when the stimulus money gets into your parents’ bank account Easy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is one of the high level points that I have been trying to get through to people for years.

<|startoftext|>Let’s dissect this: Making a satellite: No big deal. Even middle school students are doing that: NASA Mission Supports Launch of CubeSats Built by Students Launching a satellite into space: That requires a FAA/AST license to launch from a FAA/AST licensed launch facility. There is no hypothetical way a high school student is going to build and launch their own rocket to place a CubeSat into LEO (low Earth orbit). None. And the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League are all liberal arts centered anyway. Think MIT for that. And it is still No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The colleges and the census bureau can account for that. Indeed it is fairly easy to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8 hours?????? The average time a high school student spends “In a class” at the school is about 5 hours per day. The rest of the time is changing classes, free time, eating lunch, etc. Therefore, the student should be spending upwards of 5 hours per day online with their school’s teachers or online suggested resources for five days per week. Then you can do 25 hours of home work and studying over the seven days of the week.<|endoftext|>

MOre than likely they would move from the the NCAA D-3 college after graduation to one of the USL clubs in the USA/Canada and then try to show their talent and get brought up to one of the MLS clubs.

However, the colleges will Not be returning any money related to Tuition. The colleges are working out methods for the students to finish their Spring term course work and therefore the tuition is the same. Period. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, if you are Not listed as a dependent on your parents 2019 or 2018 federal tax forms. Then you would need a Social Security number (you probably have one) And have filed a Federal tax return in 2018 or for 2019 (already). However, many college undergraduate students are listed as dependents on their parents’ federal tax returns. However, the parents already get a $2,500 tax Credit for that: Education Tax Credits and Deductions You Can Claim in 2019 - NerdWallet So, if you are listed as a dependent, instead of your parents getting an additional $500 added to their check, they will get $2,500 Reduction in the taxes they pay for 2019 tax year. I believe that $2,500 is generally larger than $500. Correct???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We did this twice, in 1983 and 1987 (Boston to Los Angeles and back). LA to BOS is a better example. We had a small 2-bedroom apartment with a small combined dining area/living room and a real small kitchen. So we had roughly the quantity of things to move including my engineering books, and we had a 1983 Mazda 626 and a 1984 Mazda RX-7 We (my company) hired a major moving company that loaded everything, including the RX-7, into a moving van large trailer. They loaded 60 % of the trailer, then built a “structure” that protected the RX-7 from the furniture and boxes, and backed the RX-7 into the van at the end. I had loaded some moving things into the RX-7. They can accommodate any reasonable sized car. Then we jumped into the Mazda 626 and took a 2-week vacation by driving the Southern route from LA to Boston. Friends assisted the movers in directing them where to put boxes/things when the movers arrived at our small home in ten days. Worked like a charm. A car in each direction inside the moving van. Drive one car for fun USA vacation. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t checked for a while, but if you are a college student and a dependent of your family, then there is a Large tax deduction for paying for college tuition for your parents (family) to take.

<|startoftext|>As colleges that I follow are deciding it seems common that: Students will either get a letter grade for the Spring subjects or get Pass/No-Record There will be No refunds for Spring tuition There will be refunds for dormitory time not-used: pro-rated in some format There will be refunds for meal tickets not used I believe the colleges will first credit the student’s account with the refund. Therefore, the student can use that money to pay for any future costs at the university. Then when the student is no longer attending the college, the college will issue a check for the remaining balance in the student’s account. Simple and common sense. What else would one expect???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are discussing an elite Private US college, then the probability of that working will be exceedingly small. The elite Private colleges all want to see your high school transcript and will want a cover letter of recommendation from your high school guidance counselor…. What will that state??? However, most if not all US states have a guaranteed process for you to attend a local community college for two years and then automatically start as a junior in that state’s top Public university system. Merely find the process for your state. Do very well at the state university and you have a much better chance of becoming a fully-funded graduate student at a top research university. Indeed, several years ago it was stated that 20% of the people in the USA with PhD or Doctor degrees did some of their college work at community colleges. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. You need a maneuverable satellite that can “add some mass” to the large junk in a way that will make its orbit deteriorate at a higher rate and then reenter the lower atmosphere and burn up. For the small debris, a maneuverable satellite with a high power laser will do nicely. Update David reminded me that mass is not the proper way to describe the additional material added to the larger space junk. It is best to think of it as a light weight Space Sail or drag enhancer. There is still drag even at and above the International Space Station’s orbit. By increasing the drag, the degradation of the orbit altitude will accelerate and the junk will enter the lower atmosphere quicker and burn-up. For larger “junk” that may not burn-up, you want to add a propulsion package with a communication link for control from Earth. Then the orbit can be degraded intelligently and allow the larger mass to impact into the ocean and not on land.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In general, I think of a Woman as a female who is 18 years old or older. Therefore, the person is an adult. You pack Your suitcase with Your clothes, and walk out the door and have a friend drive you somewhere like a shelter to stay. Since you are asking the question, you probably don’t have a job, no credit card, and you do Not own your own cellphone and cellphone service. So give the cellphone back to your parents, who loaned it to you, and move on with your life. If you are 18 or older, their is no legal way your parents can prevent you from moving out in with a friend or to a homeless shelter. However, you may need to buy your own suitcase, as you may have been borrowing your parents’ suitcase previously. Good luck. Maybe check out the nearest military recruitment office.

<|startoftext|>Thinking back over time, I met a girlfriend’s father when I was 16, and then several more over the years until I met my wife and her father…. It was always polite conversation. It is up to the “boy friend” to start the conversation and the father to keep it going politely. You can find out a lot about someone by the way they conduct a general conversation.

<|startoftext|>High school students can join a local Amateur Rocket society group and participate in the many activities of those groups which includes building and launching rockets. Indeed, with a very good sponsor and an excellent adviser, you could form your own Amateur Rocket society chapter. All rocket launches with engines above a certain size and above a certain anticipated altitude above mean sea level (MSL), will require a license from the FAA/AST About the Office of Commercial Space Transportation Almost all amateur rocket launches are suborbital, and most of those do not even reach “the edge of space” or roughly 100 km MSL. There may be one or two college organized amateur rocket chapters that have come close to putting something into orbit with their own rocket. However, NASA does have a program for high school students to build their own satellites, and have them carried (space available) on other NASA sponsored commercial rocket launches. NASA Mission Supports Launch of CubeSats Built by Students So, within the confines of a safe and well-regulated Amateur Rocket club, a high school student can assist in building and launching sub-orbital rockets that are licensed by the FAA.

<|startoftext|>First: What is your definition of hazing? In my mind and the mind of everyone who attended college in the 1970’s, it should be something that is hazardous to the health of the person being “hazed” and in general, is Stupid. Yes, there were people who were Hazed at MIT in some fraternities. Indeed the famous Smoot measurement of the Harvard Bridge next to MIT is an example of a “prank” that most people today would erroneously consider to be Hazing. Smoot - Wikipedia And fraternities who did Stupid and dangerous things to pledges or members were Shut Down. However, every school/college sport team that I have ever been associated with had a “Freshman carry the equipment out and back” requirement. Indeed, on the US Supreme Court, the newest (not youngest) Supreme Court Justice is required to get up and answer the door whenever they are in discussions among the nine of them. Hazing (per my definition) in itself is being eliminated every where. Yet there are still “bonding things” for new members of everything.<|endoftext|>

If you are going to pack-up and relocate for a full two years it may be nice to be able to stay in that region and work for several years before packing-up and moving any distance again.

<|startoftext|>Neither MIT nor any of the elite Private US universities look at “GPA”. None. Because if there are 1000 high schools around the world, then there are 1000 different ways to calculate GPA. GPA is merely a number to keep the Parents happy. Nothing more. 98% of the MIT enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their graduating class. However, that includes the elite exam schools and the private boarding schools, etc. So you probably need to be in the top 2% of your graduating class from a normal public high school. And a leader. Whereas, if you are in the top 15% of an exam school or private boarding school class you will probably make it to MIT or another elite private US college. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the FAA permitted it, then instead of having 200 passengers and 4 flight attendants (one for every fifty passengers) there were a maximum of 50 passengers and only one flight attendant, then there is a direct operating cost savings. With 150 fewer passengers and all of their luggage, the airlines could haul more freight/cargo. If that happens and the total weight is the same, the fuel cost will be the same. So, then to make the same amount of money then they will charge for the cargo/freight and probably have 20 first class passengers and 30 economy passengers. With that and two fewer flight attendants (one for first class and one for coach), they will probably make the same profit per flight. Nice!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In junior high school and high school it was relatively easy. Taking all honors classes, but we had a whole Year per topic, whereas in college the same material is covered in one term (or less). Also an honors class in high school would cover the top 25 students in the class. However only the top 5 to 10 may be going to college like MIT or Harvard or Princeton. Therefore the colleges are teaching to a much higher level of students and the material will come Faster and Much Harder. So, easy in junior and senior high school and had to work very hard to be a top student in my department at MIT. But it was all worthwhile.<|endoftext|>

But if you like to snow-ski, forget Philadelphia. I have known people who have attended each of those universities and they All loved their experience at either BC or Villanova. You can’t go wrong at either one, as long as you believe that the one you attend is the best fit for You.

Therefore the major con is it will cost you at Least $75,000 per year with little or no financial aid from UCI or any UC campus (assuming you are not a recruited NCAA D-1 athlete).

<|startoftext|>No. The proper method for driving is to adjust your mirrors Prior to starting to drive. Since you should have driven to the road test starting site (with a licensed adult in the passenger seat), your mirrors should already be adjusted properly.

<|startoftext|>There have been a lot of questions like this on Quora and hopefully they can lumped together. First, a Glider is an airplane. An unpowered airplane. Gliders with Lift to Drag ratios in excess of 30, can glide for Hours, and with a skilled pilot who can “find the updrafts” stay aloft as long as the pilot wants to. Where as an airliner, with its engines operating, as at least an 18 to 1 Lift to Drag ratio and with the engines not running (and thus adding to the drag), they probably have at least a 14 to 1 Lift to Drag ratio Therefore, if the airplane is cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet MSL and then shuts down the engines, it should be able to glide roughly 14 * 35,000 or 93 miles. It can probably get to at least 95 miles using the flaps at low altitude. Over the USA, that means that it should be able to find a runway somewhere. Enjoy your flight, engines or no engines…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I asked the question. The Panavia Tornado - Wikipedia was developed by an European Consortium to be a dual capable fighter-bomber in NATO. Therefore, with US assistance it can carry certain nuclear gravity bombs. Currently, the F-16C and the F-15E are dual capable for the USA. The F/A-18 C/D used to be dual capable, but the Navy/Marines have not had a nuclear gravity bomb role for “a while”. And why would the Germans want a F/A-18D for a dual capable fighter bomber when they are “roughly” the same age/vintage??? So, the current comparison is: Convert the Eurofighter Typhoon - Wikipedia to be dual-capable Why would the USA assist with that? Procure either the F/A-18F or the F/A-15EX and certify the one that is selected Boeing currently makes both The F-15E is currently dual capable The F-15E has more range and payload capability than the F/A-18F NOTE: The Tornado has two flight crew members, and so does the F-15EX and the F/A-18F So, it seems to me, that if Boeing and the USA is going to be involved that the F-15EX with dual capability is the logical choice, No? The F-15EX would have better payload and range than the Tornado and the Super Hornet has less….. Why waste time re-certifying a non-contender??? Update: Germany reportedly moving toward a split buy of Super Hornets, Growlers and Eurofighter Typhoons to replace Tornado jets The article states that a lot of work would be required to make the F/A-18F nuclear capable, but that Boeing is up to the task. However, the same Boeing supports the F-15EX and that would be a Much better choice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good question, as my mother, along with many in the 1950’s and 1960’s was a stay-at-home mother. So she believed that she was responsible for a lot of the “work” around the house. My father did all of the repairs around the house (electrical, plumbing and carpentry) so we rarely if ever needed to hire anyone to do that work. Plus my father had two jobs: an engineer for the NY State DOT and a professional engineer and land surveyor on his own, so he worked a lot. When I was old enough, I shoveled the snow (with some help from my mother) and mowed the lawn and raked the leaves. My dad would cook some special meals and would help in washing the post-meal dishes and pans. My mother did all of the laundry with help from the children and she cleaned the house. So it was a good partnership between my mother and father with a Lot of assistance from the children. The same in most families that I knew back then.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For the USA: Assuming you are under 24 years old and your parents are willing to assist you in filling out the online FAFSA forms to apply for Federal student aid: If your family is sufficiently economically challenged you can be awarded a Pell Grant up to (roughly) $6,000 per academic year which typically pays for all tuition and fees and books/supplies for you to commute to a local community college. Most if not all states have a pre-planned path directly from community college (2 years) to become a junior at your state’s top public university system. Check the details in your state and contact your local community college Therefore the first two years of college were “free” (you paid commuting expenses and bought some food while living at home for free) For your junior and senior years at your state’s top Public university system, you will continue to get (roughly) $6,000 from the Federal Pell Grant plus you can borrow from the Federal Direct loan program $7,500 per academic year (for junior and senior years). That is $13,500 per year which typically covers in the in-state cost of a Public university for tuition, fees, and books/supplies. You will need to work during the summer (full time) and part-time on-campus to try and earn $11,000 per year to pay for room & board at the state university.

I never ice skated until I was 22 years old, and then on a dare I decided to learn so I could play goaltender on my graduate department’s C-league intramural team. But I loved it and worked hard and harder and played as much as “8 days per week”. I wasn’t naturally talented but just doggedly persistent. And I turned that into becoming the “third string” goaltender on MIT’s men’s intercollegiate ice hockey team (graduate students were allowed on the team back then).

<|startoftext|>Because there is a constant and continuous (for ever) gravitational attraction between every object and the Earth. Because of that, all objects will move towards the surface of the Earth. So, if you have a book sitting on a table that is in your back yard, that book has “stored potential energy” because it is above the Earth’s surface.. If you were to slowly slide the book to the edge of the table so it eventually falls off the table, the potential energy will all convert to kinetic energy as it accelerates towards the Earth’s surface in your back yard. As the book is traveling through the air, there will be a drag force that is due to the Work that that book is doing by moving the air. Eventually the book hits the ground, and ignoring the small amount of air-drag work, the kinetic energy at the moment it hits the ground is equal to the potential energy that the book had when it was on the top of the table. Finally, the book hits the ground and stays there, but the kinetic energy went into the work that book did in hitting the ground, any damage to the book and the sound that the book makes when it hits the surface of the Earth.

<|startoftext|>“When it is foggy”…………. That is why they are called Fog lights…….. There are front fog lights and rear fog lights. The front fog lights may have a different visual light spectrum to reflect less from the the water droplets of the fog, and also will be aimed differently than the low-beam headlights. Do not use the high beams as they will merely reflect off the fog and “blind” the driver. The rear fog lights are bright red, possibly only one light and are Very bright so that a vehicle approaching the rear of your car will see your car in sufficient time to slow down to match speed. DO NOT USE fog lights when there is no fog, especially the rear ones. They can be bright and blinding to other drivers when there is no fog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullying is a Dynamic interaction. It is a function of what the person is doing and who the person is with and what the bully is doing and who the bully is with.

There are 200 to 400 students in a typical grade-level in middle school or high school.

Thus, ignoring the “bully” is one of several techniques that can work. Change the Dynamics. That is what works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In all of my many years buying/leasing cars from dealers and using dealers to service my cars, I have Never noticed that they over inflate the tires. Indeed, in the USA, on the driver’s side door jam there is a sticker with the car manufacturer’s recommended tire inflation pressure (front tires and rear tires as the suggested pressure may be different), and I have noted that the dealers all inflate to that pressure. NOTE: If the car is inside the dealership and the service area is at 65 deg Fahrenheit and they check the tire pressure there, and then the outdoor temperature is 20 deg Fahrenheit, the pressure will register a bit lower outside if you check it. I personally always inflate my tire one to two psi above the manufacturer's recommended tire pressure (which is still always well below the maximum tire pressure). Slightly over-inflated tires will assist in getting slightly better gasoline mileage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, not necessarily. The car manufacturer puts the suggested tire psi on the driver’s side door jam. I had a car (recently) that had 35 psi for the front tires and 36 psi for the rear tires. All four tires were the same. Just a recommendation from the manufacturer for car handling for that car. However, the tire pressure should be the same for the two front tires and the two rear tires, but the front and rear tires could have different tire pressures.<|endoftext|>

It will cost you a lot of money for that 5 semesters of work and research, but if you are one of the top 2 or 3 grad students in that college, you may be able to get a fully-funded PhD program at Stanford. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting into Harvard or MIT or any of the elite Private US colleges is: 25% demonstrating excellent academic prowess. Required but not sufficient 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character (read the article, the links and the report): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And you must get several glowing letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that.. Therefore, it should be Easy to prove your academic prowess via your transcript and the scores you get on several standardized tests that are related to the academic area you wish to pursue. But the biggest thing will be showing Harvard what a great Person you are and what you will be able to contribute to the Harvard undergraduate community outside of the classroom. The overall admission rate to Harvard is less than 6%. However, the overall admission rate of the Recruited athletes (by Harvard head coaches) is Over 80%. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How does that happen?????????? They have to have sufficient funds and health insurance to be issued a B1/B2 visa When admitted to the hospital for the birth of their child they would be required to provide health insurance info, a copy of their passport, and the hospital would use their credit card for a deposit (if they have one). The hospital will file a claim with their health insurance provider. If they have the credit card info, and the health insurance fails to pay, they will charge the parents’ credit card. If there is no credit card and no payment the hospital will: Report the incidence to the Federal Government providing the parents’ passport info Take the cost as a write-off for charitable work If the parents ever try to come to the USA again, ever, they won’t be able to. However, their child will be able to if the parents ever get the child an US passport in their home country at an US consulate or embassy. But the parents will run into trouble at the consulate or embassy since they owe money in the USA Eventually, the parents will pay or the parents and that child will never enter the USA again.

<|startoftext|>Next insurance year. My insurance company gives us a break if any one of our two cars is driven less than 7,500 miles per year or an even bigger break if driven less than 5,000 miles per year. I have to tell my insurance company how many miles I have driven each car per year (I send them the odometer readings on a signed legal form). If you drive 12,000 miles per year, and don’t drive much or any for one month, that is not going to make any difference. Just pay the insurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of the gasoline cars today, have taken the well-designed and heavy-duty starter motors from their Hybrid cars and put them in all of their gasoline cars, along with a very intelligent control system. Therefore, when stopped, the car will turn itself off. I only drive a manual transmission car, so I am not certain how those pathetic automatics work with this, but when the car is in Neutral and my foot is off the clutch, the car will decide whether to turn off the engine (it checks the status of the battery and the number of electrical systems that are running, etc.). I believe overall, I get about an extra mile-per-gallon (overall in suburban/urban driving). 25 mpg instead of 24, but I get 30 mpg on the open highway. The car restarts when I start to push the clutch pedal down, and I have Never had a problem with that. Use a system that is Designed to be turned on/off consistently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually, I liked everything that I brought college (freshman in 1969–70 at MIT). However, my dorm mates were audiophiles and when I was a sophomore, all of my hall mates Hated my AM/FM radio that I loved to play. “Bad sound”. So I was forced to head over to Tech HiFi and buy a state of art turn-table, speakers and control system. It did sound great, and my hall mates had me send that AM/FM radio home to upstate NY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were in our late 30’s when we decided to have children and had two nice sons. Here were our “rules” as we started to try to have children: Boys would have my wife’s last name and girls would have my last name First and first-middle names had to be understandable and we should like all of the possible nicknames that could be derived from those first names, as the children and their friends create the nicknames. The children would be allowed to switch their first and first-middle names when they were 12 years old Boys would have my last name as their second middle name and girls would have my wife’s last name as their second middle name. The children would be allowed to switch their second-middle and last names when they were 12 years old. Hyphenated names were Not to be allowed. First names could not be of old boy friends or girl friends of ours The initials formed from the four names could not spell anything “bad” It worked. Except, we had a second son, and my wife felt bad for me, and told me she wanted to give him my last name. We did, and followed the rules from above. Neither boy wanted to switch the order of their first/middle or second-middle and last names when they reached 12 years old. Not a single friend, family member or any of the boys’ friends even blinked nor noticed when the boys, one year apart and many times on the same sports team, had different last names. Worked like a charm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. MIT and many of the other elite private US colleges would Not ask for recommendations from teachers if they were not going to be read. Every item in an applicant’s “application folder” is read. And the teacher’s letter of recommendation is a substantiation of your academic prowess in that subject area, Plus the teacher’s letter of recommendation tells the college about you as a Person. Private colleges admit People, not academic automatons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, I had to show an ID and proof of citizenship and residency to be able to Register to vote. Any worker at a polling place can challenge you since many of the polling personnel have a general idea of who lives in that district (especially in my town). And if you haven’t voted for two years in a row, then you have to prove who you are, and that is especially important for the elections for members of Congress, electors for the president, and governor. Second, every state is producing real IDs. And, obviously, an US passport or passport card is a perfect real ID. One can’t have a bank account without an ID, and one can not get social security or medicare without some form of ID. Therefore, everyone in the USA needs some form of Real ID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The city of San Diego is very large. I believe at one time it was the largest city in the USA by area. However, there is an extensive public bus system and also a public trolley in the downtown area that heads to Tijuana. I lived in San Diego for a while (staying with my older brother) and one could take the bus and also walk or ride a bicycle. However, almost everyone had access to at least an old beat-up car.

<|startoftext|>Where are these CRAZY ideas coming from????????????? Here is how a modern airliner works: All of the air in the airplane is tossed over board, roughly once per hour. About six times per hour, half of the air is definitely “tossed overboard”. The remaining half is sent through a special HEPA filter that removes the smallest virus or bacteria. The other half of the new air comes from the 4th to 6th (depending on the engine) compression stage of the engine, and on some Boeing aircraft that air is at 450 degrees Fahrenheit and 42 psi. The two halves are mixed (which would Kill any potential remaining bacteria or viruses) and sent through an air conditioning system prior to being sent back into the aircraft cabin, crew station and for electronics cooling. A modern Airbus or Boeing airliner air is the cleanest air of any transportation system. Period. End of discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am trying to comprehend that, for the game with a referee on the field. Indeed, in the beginning, there were merely players on the field, and they invited knowledgeable people whom they trusted to watch the game from the side of the field and if there was a controversy on a foul and the restart, they Referred to that person. Eventually that person was given a whistle and invited on the field to be a referee…… So with a referee on the field with a whistle to stop play and the authority of the Laws of the Game, I could see an apology replacing a formal Caution (or back then a “booking”) but I can’t see it replacing a free kick for the offended Team. One may assume that in early baseball or cricket matches, that the players agreed on the field before they “hired” or assigned umpires to the games. Indeed, most sports started as a Gentlemanly pursuit and the players were supposed to be Polite and Fair…………………………………<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are some companies (Law firms for example) that have very serious company basketball or softball leagues.

<|startoftext|>I don’t see why not. Most airliners keep the pressure inside the airliner at 8,000 feet MSL and the new airliners (composite fuselages of the A350 and the 787) are kept at a pressure altitude of 6,000 feet MSL. If you can wear a nicotine patch in Mexico City at an altitude of 7,300 feet, I can’s see why you can’t wear one while flying in an airliner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Under the Laws of the Game (FIFA) and the college and high school rules in the USA, they are all the same: Any player who receives a Red Card is dismissed from the game, and may Not be replaced, therefore the team plays short-handed for the remainder of that game. However, if the goal keeper is dismissed (Red Card), the game does not restart until the team has a person designated as the new goal keeper and wearing a different color jersey. That could be one of the substitutes that is available in the team area, if the team has not used up its maximum number of subs, or a field player switching to the position of goal keeper. As for Punishment beyond that: That is up to the individual league. Many leagues will not allow that player to play in the next game (and that gets complicated if the next game is not a league game, etc.). In the USA, in high school the player can not play in the next Two games. That is independent of whether it was a “straight red card” or a red card for cautionary offense, having previously been cautioned in that game. However, some professional leagues will have monetary fines for players who are dismissed from a game, and the amount of the fine may be a function of the type of red card received or for what. It is all league by league and tournament by tournament. For example here are the procedures used by the MLS in the USA and Canada: MLS Competition Guidelines 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early days of aviation? It takes a good engine that can operate in a thin atmosphere to fly at the higher altitudes. And it is COLD at those altitudes. It is Below freezing by the time you are at 14,000 ft MSL. That tends to keep the early aircraft lower. And the bombers in World War II had oxygen masks for the crew and the flight crews were Freezing….. They needed electric warmers in their flight suits…..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I sincerely doubt that the admissions staff is looking that closely. And what is a word? They are looking mostly for “length”, and if it is “too long” then that will count against you, but 15 words is like an extra line…..

<|startoftext|>Two words: Do Not. If you want to appeal a freshman admissions denial or an undergraduate transfer denial, then Do Not. There are Many thousands upon thousands who have been denied admission and the dedicated admissions staff do not have the time nor resources to address appeals.

<|startoftext|>Everyone with whom I was a graduate student at MIT (and I) received free tuition and a stipend towards our living expenses. The stipend was sufficient to pay for reasonable room, board and utilities in a shared apartment of house. Others, whom I know, got a job in their field and did very well as employees. They then used their employee benefits to pay for the tuition for their masters (attending a near-by good graduate program part-time). Easy. Whereas those that were seeking a MBA, a law degree or a medical degree would borrow $100K to $400K to pay for everything, expecting to pay all of that back about ten years later. Not as easy, but doable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 1969 I rejected a $1,000 per year scholarship to attend Any college in NY State (to which I was admitted.)

MIT’s tuition for the full-academic year (my freshman year) was $2,150. Over the course of the four years at MIT, my total Tuition (tuition only) was about $9,300. So, I turned down a 43% scholarship to attend the college with the best fit for me. Simple. And no loans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of course you can. If you parents have three cars and each of them drives, and you drive on a regular basis as a teenager, then the insurance company will place the least experienced and most risky driver on the most expensive car.

<|startoftext|>I am conflicted on this whole booster recovery. First, an airliner is designed for 60,000 flight hours at 3,000 hours per year and is a totally different subject. These boosters are designed for, at most, ten reuses. However, that is Only if the payload of the Falcon is below a certain mass and/or the orbit is below a certain altitude. Otherwise the booster needs all or most of its fuel for the launch and does not have enough to turn around and “head home”. Then there is the cost of the drone ships and the personnel who need to monitor/control the recovery. Then there are the insurance companies that insure launches and their payloads and how they will feel about using reused boosters. Given all of that, the SpaceX recovery of boosters is almost a Barnum and Bailey stunt for advertising. Nice, but not the full solution. Still working on the full solution….<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Two major accidents over the last 50 years… Driving across the USA, I left at night from San Diego to get to near the Grand Canyon in August (cooler at night), fell asleep and rolled the car over. Got 150 external stitches and unknown internal stitches in my scalp. My brother brought me back to San Diego to recuperate. Knowing that if you fall off your horse you need to get back in the saddle, he tossed me the keys to his Corvette and told me to drive to the store to get some items. That was about 18 hours after the accident. Winter of 2015, slowing traffic on an interstate, and a pick-up truck with a huge plow was distracted, did not slow down and rear-ended the car behind me, which then smashed into my rear-end, and through some miraculous steering I managed to swerve around the car ahead of me, only clipping the rear left quarter panel and somehow avoiding traffic in the next lane. My car ended up (a week later) being “totalled” by the insurance company, but that evening, I drove the smashed up car home. Minutes after the accident. Even though the state police recommended a flat-bed truck to take my car. Just get back into the saddle and drive again. Less than 24 hours after the accident or within 24 hours of being released from the hospital. Indeed, see if you can drive yourself home from the hospital.<|endoftext|>

However, I had a Huge feeling of responsibility and safety for myself and others. The proper use and care of the guns takes thought and effort and time. And one needs to remain proficient. And since my ammunition was always stored away from my guns (and locked away), I would first call the Police before getting a gun out. And then living in a much more urban/suburban areas of greater Boston, I would never own a gun here.

<|startoftext|>Here is a “generic” helicopter fuselage construction. Those are the underlying structure, underneath the thin metal skins. Very similar to a pressurized aircraft construction. However, helicopters are not pressurized, typically, because they don’t fly that high. And therefore weight is saved. Enjoy your flight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No reason??? Righttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt………………………. We are all certain there is a reason, only you don’t want to admit it. Just accept it and be a good person. Eventually, that door (or at least a draw curtain) will appear in your doorway for when you are trying to sleep at night or get dressed/undressed. Otherwise an open door policy should be standard in all homes. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing. My two basic avocations are playing ice hockey goaltender (that is a defense-person with their brains beat out) and refereeing high school, college and adult amateur soccer (that is having at least 24 and many times hundreds if not thousands of people yelling at you). Simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want privacy? Go in the back yard behind the garage Bedroom doors remain Open until you turn the lights out to go to sleep. Then the door is shut because you are trying to go to sleep. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a Deposit. A trivial amount of money compared to the annual cost of a college education. Just Pay It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are three ways to do that: Hire an agency that finds a driver for you and that person drives your car across the USA. Typically in less than seven days Move a house-full of stuff across the country in a full moving van, and the movers can make room to place your car on the van. I did that twice, once from Boston to Los Angeles and then the return trip several years later. Figure on ten to 14 days Have a shipper load your car on a car carrier and send across the USA. Tht could be 7 to 14 days depending on where cars are being shipped to and if they need to pick up cars along the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love to work with the high school aged students. Refereeing amateur soccer, I much prefer working an U19 boys game by myself than working any U13 game. I loved interviewing high school seniors for college admissions. I like working with teenagers on the verge of adulthood. And their parents interfere the least at those ages…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Family member….. Neither my siblings nor my parents nor aunts/uncles, etc live with us. Therefore, the only people who have physical access to my credit card are my spouse and my children. My credit card is her credit card. Period, end of discussion. She must have had a good reason for using your credit card. Therefore a spouse is Not part of this discussion. Therefore, you are referring to a Child (who could be 18 or older and an adult, but still a child of your family). That is Stealing and violates every norm that we taught them from the time they were one day old, by setting excellent examples for them. That would never happen in our family. Indeed, when they were seniors in high school, I Gave each son an AMEX card connected to my account (with a limit that I control online) in case of an emergency. So, if you raise a family correctly, that would never happen. And if your child is a Junkie or an Alcoholic, then you need to assist them with professional help and keep them out of your house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here are the fundamental things to do: Enroll in a college that you firmly believe is a great fit for You Select a major of true interest for you and hopefully, if you do get disillusioned by that major, that college with a great fit for you offers another major with a simple change process Work with your parents to make certain that you will have sufficient funds to pay for those four years of college (and get your bachelors degree in four years unless you are in a five year program). In doing that do Not plan (before becoming a college freshman) on borrowing more than Half of what you expect to earn as a starting annual salary upon graduation from that college in that major. Half over the compete time it takes to earn your bachelors degree (four to five years) Make friends on campus with good solid people and form a good peer-study group to assist you in making progress through your courses Have polite and professional discussions with your professors during their office hours to seek their guidance for the course work and for your potential future niche in your major Find a couple of clubs/organizations/teams on campus to provide you an outlet from being a student. Intramural sports are great for that Those are six things to do. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, I would hope not. A 212 rejection is for Fraud or becoming a “ward of the state” (coming to the USA for US government supported medical treatment or for food stamps or homeless shelter, etc.) or unlawfully and willingly over-staying your time in the USA on a different visa. Those are Serious charges. Why should: Any Department of State (DOS) staff member who interviews you, believe you won’t do something illegal like that again? And if you do convince a DOS member and get a F-1 student visa, why would the separate Department of Homeland Security customs and border patrol agent believe you and allow you in to the USA through a port of entry? Several F-1 visa holders coming to the USA were intercepted by CBP agents and immediately sent back to Europe (for example) and then they had to find their own way home from there….. Hopefully there has been five to Ten years of time that has passed since you committed those transgressions that caused the 212 rejection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, I will easily walk two miles to get somewhere. That is a nice 35 minute walk. Therefore, I would never use a bicycle for less than 2 miles let alone a car or public transportation. At 2 miles or more, how safe is the path/roads for using a bicycle? What about in bad weather with water or snow on the ground? Would you need to take a change of clothing to use that bicycle? If you can walk less than a mile to decent public transportation and then less than a mile to get to your destination, that is Perfect. I use public transportation a lot to get into Boston or back home for events (commuter rail) unless the schedule is horrible. In any of the five boroughs of New York City, I never use a car. I take the subway system and walk in-between. Great exercise and if there is a problem, switch to Uber/Lyft/Taxi. Easy. If you can take a single bus ride to your destination or use a subway/trolley system (dedicated right-of-way) then you reduce your carbon foot-print, reduce the need for more roads and parking facilities and get some exercise. Win-win-win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same way we taught our sons to be cognizant of spreading “germs”. Wash your hands when you come into the house. Wash your hands before eating anything. Wash your hands anytime you use use the bathroom. Don’t touch your face or pick at your face. Don’t get too close to friends or family. That is Basic training, that every child should have. Now for the COVID-19 you merely tell them that there is a sickness going around and that they have to stay and play at home and it will be a few weeks before they can get together with their friends. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would that be? I know that all of the seniors at MIT will be graduating at the end of this Spring term and the Olin College of Engineering is planning on graduating all of its seniors this term. They are all working on their class work and projects from home or other locations, and some from campus (MIT granted 50% of the appeals to remain on campus). Things are not as grim as you may think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several years ago a dealership allowed me to drive their new car to my home to show my wife and then return in an hour. If they believe that is what is required to close the deal, and you appear to be a reputable buyer, then merely ask. However, try to keep the total time with the new car to less tha (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has nothing to do with using an automatic transmission or a manual transmission. (However, if you have never driven before, then you probably need five hours of training on an automatic transmission car before continuing your learning on a manual transmission car.) You need to train to be a good driver Day or Night, in all of your regions weather conditions and on all of your regions types of roadways. That requires a MINIMUM of fifty hours of driving on a learner’s permit with a properly licensed adult in the front passenger seat. However, everyone in our family had over 100 hours of driving on a learner’s permit before taking the road test and passing it the first time (our sons using our manual transmission cars). It is about being licensed to drive a two-ton Weapon for the remainder of your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, you merely attend the Public high school in your school district for free. Easy.

<|startoftext|>First business class is primarily for overseas flights from the USA (within the USA it is typically first class and two types of economy class) On international flights there are two types of economy tickets, business and first class.

Therefore, just pay the difference, I am certain your parents will appreciate your generosity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On one of my flights, one half of my seat belt was missing on a full flight.

<|startoftext|>It has already been state on Quora many times that you do Not have to have a drivers license in order to own and register an automobile in the USA. And the car is insured, not the drivers. However, since you only have a learner’s permit, you Must have a licensed adult over the age of 21 in the car with you when you arrive to take your road test. Your car must be properly registered in your state, and the car must meet the minimum standards for the road test as published by Your state’s department of motor vehicles. (Many states require a rear seat in the car, so the licensed adult can sit back there during the road test.) Good luck.<|endoftext|>

I would have checked the route in advance and plan on where to stop for gasoline and food breaks (lunch) I might pack a lunch and eat it in the car. I will have snacks and also drinks with me. Coffee for the morning and diet-coke for the remainder of the drive. I can also stop to buy more drinks/snacks, but I try to have a sufficient supply with me when I start the drive.

<|startoftext|>At the youth and high school and college level, what you would consider to be “trash-talk”, we referees/umpires consider that to be Unsporting Behavior and deserving of at Least a warning and then in soccer a caution and then an ejection from the game. And in high school sports, if the “trash talk” is deemed Taunting the other team, then it is an immediate ejection. So, in a sense, it is banned….. However, what you consider trash talk may be considered normal “banter” among the professional players. Catcher to batter talk. Talk among basketball players. Talk among ice hockey players who see each other dozens of times each season. They are Professionals and should know how to handle such talk, but yet there is still a limit to the “trash” that is allowed to be spoken and the referees and umpires will deal with it.

If it is your vehicle, PAY THE TICKET immediately if you were parked in that area. Period. After paying the full price of the ticket and surcharge, ask if you can contest the surcharge because there was never a ticket on your car. If you try to contest the surcharge before paying, then the charges keep increasing…….. Pay the Ticket and then contest the surcharge.

<|startoftext|>All US (and I believe Airbus) airliners are designed essentially the same way: Roughly 6 times per hour, half of the air within the airplane is dumped “over board” and half is passed through a series of HEPA filters which can screen out even the tiniest bacteria or virus. That now fully-clean air from the cabin is mixed with engine bleed air (taken from somewhere in the 4th - 7th stages of the jet engine compressor) that is at 450 degrees Fahrenheit and now the mixed air is at over 200 deg F and if any bacteria or virus survived to that point, the heat kills them, and then the combined air is put through one of two air conditioning systems on the aircraft and sent back into the cabin for you to breath. That air is the cleanest air you will ever breath. You can be assured of that. Enjoy your flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I applied a long time ago, but I have assisted others and interviewed many over the years. Here are the high points that I note: Applicant must be organized and start early. Take the PSAT first term junior year. Take the SAT/ACT and two SAT subject tests 2nd term junior year Have long polite conversations with trusted teachers and your guidance counselor junior year and continue into senior year. Ask a couple of teachers from junior year if they will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf. Then when they return to school in September or late August, they will write the letter and you will be ahead of the curve Everyone should be able to submit at least one early application by November 1st Visit college campuses of different types that are within a day’s drive of where you live. No need as a sophomore or a junior to have to fly a long way for that. Combine campus visits with Nice family vacations. Make it Fun. Determine what Majors (plural) you may wish to pursue then focus on colleges that offer all of those majors so the worse that happens in the future is you change departments and not have to transfer colleges And do detailed cost-effectiveness assessment for You. If You attend that college and major in that subject area and then get a job upon graduation, what is the likely starting salary. Then do Not plan to borrow more than Half of that starting salary in the four year process of earning a bachelor degree. Period You may borrow more during the four years due to “things” that change, but do not plan on that as a high school senior If offered an interview with a volunteer from a college to which you applied, Take It and make it a nice polite two-way discussion. The interviewer will Not be interested in you as a Student, but as a whole Person who could be a student at their alma mater. When you have several admissions in April of senior year, visit each one, even if that means flying across the USA. Those next four years are too important to skimp on a little family vacation 3000 miles from home. Enjoy the process. With a little pre-planning it is a Lot of fun!!!<|endoftext|>

You can go into any career from engineering: business, law, medicine, chef, etc. and I have known people who have gone from engineering into all of those fields and more. And, since I like MIT and think it has a wonderfully complete web site, merely explore the many engineering department offerings at MIT to see what a wide selection of careers and pursuits are available, then find some good colleges that have a wide selection of engineering departments.

<|startoftext|>The seniors are actually in a good position. They would already have visited many colleges over the last two years and have a good sense of what various college campuses are all about, especially Public vs Private. Therefore, they will take their list of acceptances, and go online for an hour per acceptance and explore that college, its resources, its undergraduate community, the surrounding area (think Trip Adviser) and check the climate. Once they have done that, they will review the financial aid award letters, being careful to remember that loans and work-study are not real aid. The only real aid are Grants and Scholarships. They have to pay back a loan and work at minimum wage on-campus, respectively. Then they make a decision (with the guidance of their parents and e-mail communication with trusted teachers and guidance counselor), and accept an offer and pay the non-refundable deposit. Simple. The tough part will be if the Covid-19 virus closes campuses this fall………… The ones who are hurting are the Juniors who wanted to start college visits and may not be able to visit any colleges before they have to send in their applications this coming fall.

<|startoftext|>For our family, there were two types of vacations. The ones where we could drive our car and the ones where we needed a bigger vehicle to drive or we needed to fly to be close to the vacation spot. I have a rule of thumb: The cost of the transportation should only be about One-Third of the cost of the entire vacation or you are not staying long enough. We had a family of four and our two sons were 15 months apart so essentially the same age for most vacations once they were both in elementary school and older. Our second Rule (firm) we do Not fly with a child under the age of twelve months. Period. Therefore, until the youngest is at least one year old, you will be driving. If you drive your own car/vehicle then I only count the cost of: one tune-up which you will do before the extended vacation, plus the cost of the gasoline and tolls. (Versus charging the US government’s rate of $0.575 per mile for the use of a car.) So for the driving vacations, we could take one to two weeks and go within a 500 mile radius of our home. That covered most if not all of New England (we live near Boston) and therefore covered an extended ski vacation for the Winter or an extended beach or lake vacation for the Summer. Perfect. My spouse’s parents had, for a while, a very nice and large home in New Hampshire on a nice lake and that was a Great Summer vacation when the boys were young. Cost was not really a factor and a 5 to 8 day vacation was easy. We obviously bought or brought food for the family so there is cost. But that is a “no brainer” vacation that is limited by the time you want to stay away from your home. Budget $150 to $200 per night for not too expensive hotel/motel/guest-home cost for the family of four. Maybe as much as $250 per night. $60 per day for food and snacks, and another $100 per day for tickets to amusement parks. Whereas, if you are renting a minivan for your extended in-country or to Canada vacation, then you may spend close to $900 on the transportation, so you want to spend at least $1800 on the food, lodging and entertainment to make that travel worthwhile (rule of thumb #1, above). If you are going across the USA or to Europe, then the found trip air fare will be on the order of $2,000 (plan ahead) plus $500 for local travel so the total trip will run close to $7,500. Doing, that, we never came home thinking we should have stayed longer, and everyone had a great time. NOTE: Before we flew the boys to Europe (Italy and Switzerland) we drove them to Quebec City area in our car and checked out: Could then deal with a foreign language? Could they deal with foreign food? Could they “pack” and more importantly carry their own luggage? Could they walk “forever” through places of interest to us the adults (half of the time)? They did that flawlessly at age 9 and 10 so then the following year it was Italy and Switzerland for 20 days. NOTE: Everything I am discussing took place prior to 2008, so keep that in mind, but I am trying to use current prices. There is a hint of a budget in what I have listed. NOTE: Once the boys were 11 years old, they spent two weeks at a day camp during the summer, first year, and then two weeks at an overnight camp deep in the woods and away from technology for the next five years. We could then take driving vacations taking them to the overnight camp and picking them up and returning. Additionally, once the oldest is a junior in high school, your “Spring Break” vacation will become a family vacation combined with a tour of college campuses. Good luck and enjoy your vacations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe the average cost of center-based daycare for a toddler in the USA is about $900 per month. Whereas if the care can be provided in your own home, that can be reduced to about $750 per month. Of course that will go up dramatically when the child is a pre-schooler (3 to 5). Then there is the cost of the pre-school and then the cost of the after school daycare. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, you must be a citizen to vote in state-wide elections. There are No federal elections merely state-wide elections to decide who goes to Congress or which electors the state sends to decide who should be president and vice-president. That is why it is the United States of America. However, some states are allowing the local towns to have some elections in which a resident of that town, who is not a citizen of the USA, can vote. Those elections are separate dates from the state-wide elections. Those non-citizens who are residents of that local town are paying taxes to that town for the local government and in some cases the local people want all of the residents to have a chance to vote. Nothing wrong with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, when your tires were at a nominal 70 degrees Fahrenheit you pumped the tires to the recommended pressure or at most one or two psi above that recommended tire pressure (NOT the maximum tire pressure), then you should be fine. Get a Good tire gauge, and AutoZone has some excellent ones for about $15, and check your tire pressure once per week when the car is sitting and not in the sun and has not been driven for a few hours. If the pressure remains basically constant, for several weeks you can reduce the frequency. It is Cold weather that reduces the pressure of tires as the air gets denser and less volume and “things shrink” which could open some small gaps and allow small amounts of air to leak out.

<|startoftext|>Good question. From my experience, the large public universities require the freshman applicant to indicate what their desired major is, and the department has some input into the admissions process. As you asked the question, I would surmise that the Civil Engineering student would have a better chance of admission than the Computer Science student as CS is a horribly over-subscribed major. And that Civil Engineering student would have a tough time transferring to Computer Science once a student at UIUC, but the student may be able to minor in computer science, as every engineer has to be able to use computers well. But what person interested in Civil Engineering would want to major in Computer Science??? It all works out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am certain there are some great “strange experiences” in the many answers. One I look back-on with fondness, was as a graduate student at MIT in the late 1970’s. Boston is famous for tough driving and terribly confusing roadways. And back then the signage was missing. You could drive for miles on a road and never know what road you were on. One day I am at traffic light getting ready to proceed onto a bridge that will take me across the river from Boston to Cambridge. A car next to me yells over that they need directions. I nod my head and they say: “How do we get to New York City?” I think to myself, oh there is No way to describe all that they need to do to get to the entrance of the Massachusetts Turnpike. So, I yell over, just follow me, and when I point to the entrance to the Mass Turnpike (I-90) take it. I spend the next 15 minutes driving them across this, and around that and turning here and there and finally pointing to the large overhead sign for I-90 West (please Lord tell me they went West and not East…) I still think fondly of that time….<|endoftext|>

Subsequent delays will result in a caution. Six seconds is merely a guideline for the referee.

<|startoftext|>Yes Here is the opening statement of the FIFA Laws of the Game regarding a throw-in A throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the ball when the whole of the ball passes over the touchline, on the ground or in the air. Some times, in the last minute or two of a game with one team ahead by one goal, the team that is ahead will “boot the ball down field” to run down the time. If the ball goes out-of-touch in the other team’s defending third of the field, the goal keeper may run from the penalty area to take the throw-in, and there is nothing wrong with that. A goal keeper, outside the team’s penalty area, is just like any other field player. Interesting enough US colleges (NCAA soccer rules) state this restriction: Note: The player taking the throw-in may not use stickum or adhesive material of any kind (including gloves with an adhesive surface) to enhance the grip on a throw-in. I have brought this up with the national interpreter concerning a goal keeper taking the throw-in, and, as long as it is a merely a quick restart, let it go. Many goal keepers’ gloves are made to grip the ball better….. Just allow it, as described above. The team that is losing 99.999% of the time is not going to bring the goalkeeper all the way down field to take the throw-in that is attacking the goal. A field player will do that, and the goal keeper will be towards the center of the field, to have one more unmarked attacker.<|endoftext|>

They also tell us that the direct operating cost per available seat mile should be less than what they are currently paying.

For the military, they have a similar set of requirements, including “detectability” (Stealth) and survivability.

<|startoftext|>Yes, based upon the definition and info in your question. They could maneuver in reentry flight and they had various means of moving cargo from the bay with robotic arms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would believe that if the high school restarts teaching in the facility and students return to the class rooms, that extracurricular activities within the school also will start. Therefore, Spring sports should restart with some modified schedule. Whereas the colleges are all going home (undergraduate students) and learning online and the campuses will be empty of undergraduate students. That is different. Stay physically active while remaining at home and be prepared to restart your sport when you return to your school later in the Spring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a multi-lane (in each direction) highway in the USA, the left-most lane is for Passing, at what ever speed the driver believes is safe and prudent for the driving conditions. Passing. Once you pass the other vehicle or a short line of vehicles you move to the right and clear the left-most lane. Easy and simple. Don’t be distracted with your driving by worrying about people driving in other lanes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is the info: sexual-harassment-training I will assume that any employer in NYC with 15 or more employees will be fined if the training is not offered and the records of the training being completed are incomplete. I will assume that since the employer will be fined if you work there and do not take the training, that the employer will fire you and therefore make the record keeping easy. I and many people across the business world take these and other types of on-line training each year. Indeed, I also take a sexual harassment training course to be a college soccer referee in some conferences. Just do it. Easy and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably because a lot of parents of New York City school children can not stay home to care for them.

<|startoftext|>Good question.

<|startoftext|>Simple: The parents. The parents get to vote on the school committee and then they should remain as far from the school as possible, unless the school administration or the teachers invite them to come to the school. We did that, and our parents did that. Parental interference is ruining US schools<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to? In general, I believe they will Credit your account for some of the money you already paid for the dorm room and for any unused meal tickets. Therefore, in the Fall when you return to college, your account will have money it it that you can use to pay for next year’s room and board. Finally, when you are leaving the college for good, you and the college will close-out your account that the college will send you a check for the amount that they owe you. Enjoy the time-away from college and use it productively.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The US Bill of Rights are the first ten amendments of the US constitution. Those “rights” only apply to you and the Government’s action towards you.

They do apply to state governments and local governments interacting with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In soccer, a “tackle” is to take the ball away from an opponent. If the opponent does not have the ball, there is nothing to “tackle”. In US tackle football, you are only supposed to tackle the player that is carrying the football. If your are in the process of tackling the opponent and just before you make contact, the ball comes loose or is thrown away, you may still complete your tackle. That, however, does Not apply to the opposition punter, and you have to be careful with a late tackle on a quarterback.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, many times it can increase the cost of your insurance. We always have two cars at our home. When we added our two teenage sons to the policy for the same two cars, even though they were listed as “occasional” drivers, the cost went up because new teenage drivers pay a lot for insurance. If your twin brother moves in with you any you share the same car and have the same driving record and you are both listed on the insurance policy for that one car, you may not pay more, but you won’t pay less.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An internship is merely a short-term Job. It could be a summer Job, or a 6 to 7 month Co-Op Job. I had a seven month Co-Op job. I did not even apply. One of my professors called up an aerospace company that he knew (North American Rockwell at the time) and told them about me and they told him to send me along. He told me, and the next day I was driving from Boston to Los Angeles. By the end of the 7 month period I was the interim lead of my group. I guess everything went well…… My youngest son needed a summer job and I mentioned it to a friend who owned a small business. He told me to have my son call him for a phone interview. He got the job and did very well. I have many stories of someone who needed an internship or a Co-Op job or a summer job and Knew someone who Knew someone who got them in the door for the interview. Life is: Who do you know? and What do you know? Who who know, gets you the interview. What you know gets you the job. So, who do you know? That is the answer to your question. Check with your professors, your department headquarters and your college’s job placement office. And don’t forget to check with family, friends and friends’ family….. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When our sons were in college (graduated in 2013 and 2014) I was a joint owner of their bank accounts that they had near their colleges. I always made certain that there were a few dollars in their accounts to help them cover miscellaneous expenses. They also had a credit card attached to their bank account (and I could see what they were using the card for) and they had an AMEX card tied to my account with a pre-set limit for emergencies and they were not to use it except in an emergency. So, in a “sense” I always made certain that they had some spending cash and I didn’t have to replenish it much. We had spent the first 18 years of their lives teaching them by setting examples to be Frugal. I guess it worked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In general, the rule of thumb using the units common to the USA is: One car length of space for every 10 mph of traffic speed, with one car length as a minimum. However, if you see traffic flowing smoothly on a city major street at 30 mph, the cars are typically 1.5 to 2 car lengths apart, because the drivers are “paying attention” and can see what is ahead of the car ahead of them and know they can stop before hitting the car ahead of them if the first car slams on its brakes and then you do a half second later (22 feet traveled). Any closer to the car ahead of you and your are tailgating. And never get too close to trucks or buses, because you can’t typically see ahead of them…. and if you are too close they can’t see you….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“…without parents…” If your parents are both deceased, please accept our condolences and you will need to work with your legal guardian unless you are: 24 years old Married Have a child In the military or honorably discharged from the military Most college students will have a poor or no credit record and therefore will require a co-signer for any private student loan. NOTE: For the Federal direct student loan, you do Not need your parents’ or legal guardian’s signature, but unless you meet the exceptions, above, you will need your parents or guardian to fill-out the FAFSA forms with you. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The financial aid award sheet is typically sent along with the offer of admission.

<|startoftext|>Airbags are Supplemental Restraints and are Meant to be used with the person properly using their seat belt and shoulder harness. However, the airbags were designed to try and save the life of an unrestrained (not wearing a seat belt nor harness) adult male weighing 180 pounds. Therefore, their “impact” can be quite severe and that is why “small people” should not sit too close to where an airbag will deploy, and babies in car seats should not be in the front passenger seat. It is like getting punched in the face by a heavy weight boxer…… So, wear your seat belt. Period. Indeed, if everyone wore seat belts and shoulder harnesses, cars would Not need airbags except from the steering wheel for the driver, due to the steering wheel. “We have met the enemy and it is Us.” We need airbags in passenger seats because of the absolutely poor habits of humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two things: It is unfortunate, but severe actions needed to be taken for the next 2 to 4 weeks. The NCAA could not postpone the tournaments by that amount of time. Also, many (a lot) of colleges are closing their doors to undergraduate students immediately (during or just before Spring Break) and finishing the academic year with special on-line classes. Therefore, the athletes would not be together to train or play. Therefore, not only are all the Winter sports tournaments cancelled, but also all of the Spring sports tournaments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From looking online, the Earliest that could possibly occur would be the 2021–22 NCAA season and most likely the 2022–23 season (academic year). Rules have to be created. I hope those rules include: NCAA certification of the plans by which the colleges are paying the student-athletes for the use of their likeness in products and advertising (which is all that they are paid for, they will Not be paid to play) NCAA certification of the sports-agents who may represent the student-athletes in getting paid And, I believe, it may require laws to be passed in many individual states. They won’t pass those laws until the NCAA publishes the standards. It will happen but probably not for two more years. Relax, enjoy life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that most mobile security cameras, like that on a school bus, have just enough video storage for a complete day or two of recordings. Then the older video is over-written by the latest video. If there is an incident, it needs to be down-loaded at the end of that school day. Once down-loaded it may be stored for years. However, every school district will have a different policy. And the latest buses should have the capability to transmit the video to a central school site, if toggled by the bus driver. That video also may be kept for years, as the bus driver believes something bad is happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I and almost everyone I know totally disagrees with the stupid comment made by the head of US Soccer who was fired after saying it. Period. All entertainers (athletes and actors and dancers and singers, etc.) are paid a percentage of the money that they “bring in”. The biggest difference in the “pay” of the USWNT is the amount of money earned by FIFA for the women’s world cup versus the men’s world cup. That difference is HUGE. Therefore, the men can finish 20th and get more money than the women who finished 1st. That is just the way it is. Spectators buying tickets and the Gigantic TV rights contracts are much more for the male version of the game at the same level than for the female version of the game. And, there is also a Collective Bargaining Agreement. You meet, agree on terms (over a period of time) and you are then Bound by that contract. The USWNT will be compensated fairly per the current signed contract and based upon the money that they generate or is given to US Soccer by FIFA. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One has to have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.

<|startoftext|>In the USA, there are two types of not-for-profit colleges: Public, which are typically sponsored by the Tax-Payers of that state specifically for the use of the residents of that state. Residents get a discount and all non-residents (including international students) pay the full-amount (more money) Private: Most of the private universities (MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Duke, Tufts, Lehigh, Smith, etc. etc. etc.) charge the same amount of money for All students (US and international) NOTE: Any US college that accepts international students must be approved by the US Federal government, have a special office for international students, DSOs (designated school officials) to assist the international students and access to the online systems used for the F-1 student visas. That all costs Money. Some of the public colleges will charge more for an international student than for a non-resident US student because of that cost. Easy and very fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, No. It is a specific broadcast of the instructor for the specific students already registered in that course. Like an online seminar or discussion.

For smaller classes, (24 or less students), there may be an open-microphone with everyone not speaking on-mute.

<|startoftext|>An athlete has five years from the time they first start taking college courses after graduating from high school to play four seasons of any NCAA sport. Therefore, since none of the athletes who compete on NCAA Spring sports will be playing this Spring, they still have the same five years for four seasons. If they are a 4th year senior this year, and go to graduate school next year, and that university has that NCAA sport, then they can play one more year at that new college (in general, there are specifics). And if they are a 3rd year student and will take five years to graduate they still have 2 more seasons to play their Spring sport. That is why there is the rule of four seasons within five years. Easy. NOTE: The Winter athletes already played this season. Update: NCAA makes it official. Spring athletes who were affected by the close-downs this year will have that year of eligibility returned to them: https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/03/13/ncaa-eligibility-sports-cancelled/ Further Update: March 31st Division I Council extends eligibility for student-athletes impacted by COVID-19 Spring sport athletes get an extra year of eligibility and the Winter sport athletes Do Not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>…not allowed to do part-time jobs… I think of part-time jobs as a real job with specific hours at a store, or business etc. I worked 14 hours each weekend during the academic year as a part time worker at McDonald’s. However, I discouraged our sons from working part-time jobs during the academic school year, so they could participate more in sports and clubs. (They were Required to work Jobs during the Summer, as you should and that is where the real money is earned at 40 hours per week for 10 to 12 weeks). So, during the academic school year: umpire/referee youth sports on a flexible schedule where you sign-up for assignments each week. take care of pets in your neighborhood take care of young children in your neighborhood (maybe even while you are studying, if they are in K-3rd grade) etc in the neighborhood Work experience is great, but you don’t need nor can you earn that much money during the school year.

<|startoftext|>It is Not school clubs. It is Extracurricular activities that are Anything that you do outside of your school’s academic curriculum.

I claim that to be admitted to an elite private US college, 25% of the effort (Required) is excellent academic prowess, but that in itself is Insufficient: 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character (read the article, the links and the report): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And you must get several glowing letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that.

Today, we All carry a pressure gauge, so we would know the PSI and can read the ball to see the acceptable psi range. However, without a gauge, a skilled and experienced referee knows what a legal ball “feels like”. Hold the ball in both hands and squeeze. With experience you can tell when a ball is properly inflated. Also, drop the ball from several feet high to the floor and check the bounce height. Most of the time the ball is under-inflated and will not bounce well. Then when you have judged the two or three game balls to be properly inflated, if there are no gauges available, hand a ball to each of the captains prior to the coin-toss. They can then have the “last say”. Easy. Be polite, diplomatic, and In Charge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not that I know of. If the children are with the family the whole day (not in school) then the family would have food-stamps and would have their own food. The free lunch and sometimes free breakfast in school, is to remove the burden of preparing lunches and breakfasts early in the day when the parents may be working two jobs to try and earn enough money for the family. But there should be food in the house when there is no school. Otherwise what would the adults in the family eat and how about pre-school siblings???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we had children, we each put together a Will and a family Trust. Each will left the estate of each spouse to the other spouse or to the family trust if the other spouse also was dead. The family trust lasted until the youngest of our two sons (fifteen months apart) was 25 years old. Therefore, if both of us died, then all of the estate would go to the Trust. There were two people in charge of the Trust. One person (family) was to take care of the two sons The other (independent) person was to take care of the money and Provide regular funding to the other person who was caring for the sons, Assist the sons when they went to college or launched an apprenticeship after completing high school The trust dissolved after the youngest turn 25 and then the two sons would split the remains of the trust. The trust has now ended, and we all are doing fine, so it is time to update our wills. You must each have a will always. And when any of the children are under the age of 25 you need to have a trust and two people to run the trust as we did: one to care/advise the children who are under 25 years old and the other to rationally dole out the money to care for the children. Choose those two adults very wisely. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, yes, yes. You should Complete all of your major education (including graduate school) before having children. And you should be reasonably economically set before having children. And you should live with your spouse for at least two years before having children. Therefore, use your 20’s to prepare and then start having children when you are 28 years old or older. Good luck.

However, I also recommend that the student apply to at least one if not more (if allowed) colleges Early and those would be from the first two groups. Therefore, you don’t apply to the third group unless you did not get into one of the first two groups early. So, our sons applied to 6 and 7 colleges (no safety colleges as they both got into their #1 choice early) I only applied to 3 as I got into my #1 choice early (MIT) and “back then” we were notified before Thanksgiving. NOTE: The student should believe they are a great fit with Every college to which they apply and that each college could be cost-Effective (they won’t know the real cost until they are admitted and receive the official financial aid offer).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I will assume you want to attend: Home - Seneca, Toronto, Canada If you are a citizen or permanent resident of Canada, then the cost is very low and you should be able to earn the cost of the 4th year by working in the summers. If you are an international student, then you may not be allowed to work in Canada during the summers, unless it is directly related to your major. If you can afford 3 out of 4 years you are in good shape. The worst that would happen is that you would take a year-off to earn the money for the last year of the program. Go for it, and good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An international student on any US college campus is allowed to participate in all sports, clubs and organizations offered by that college. Period. However, the international student may have to “prove” to the college’s athletic department that the student did not play that sport at the “professional level” in the student’s country. That is only to be on the varsity team. There are many club teams and intramural teams and anyone, including ex-pros, can play on those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yale is one of only five US colleges that is: Need Blind for the admission of International freshman applicants. (along with MIT, Harvard, Princeton and Amherst College).

<|startoftext|>It is what the NCAA soccer leagues have been doing for Years. It makes complete sense. NCAA has limited substitutions. If a player requires concussion assessment, the player leaves the game, a sub comes in, and if that player is deemed OK, the player may switch back with the sub (the rule is more detailed than that, but what I stated is fine for this discussion). It is about time that FIFA look to the NCAA for some guidance in how to properly treat the physical ailments of players. In the NCAA the same holds true for a bleeding injury, to provide time for the player to stop the bleeding and change blood-soaked socks, or shorts, or jersey and then re-enter the game and the temporary sub would leave. FIFA can have an Independent doctor assigned to the games if it is worried about some type of “trickery”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the Opinion of the Referee, if the goal keepers handling of the ball outside of the team’s penalty area was to stop a ball from going Directly into the goal, then the referee will stop the game, dismiss the goal keeper (red card), that team would play short-handed and the restart would be a DFK at the spot of the handling. However, if it is merely to stop a pass, then just like with a field player (which the goal keeper is, once outside the penalty area) merely award that player a Yellow Card for a caution. Easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have suggested, for the elite Private universities, that they peg the annual tuition to be one-fourth of the average of the starting annual salaries of the most recent graduating class. For example, the current tuition (just tuition) is $53,450. When I attended MIT the tuition for my senior year was $2,500 and I could have started a job with a bachelor’s degree for $11,000 per year. Therefore, the tuition was about correct. Take the current graduating class, find the annual starting salaries. Throw out the top 10% and the bottom 10%. Then average the remaining 80%. If the average is $84,000 per year, then the tuition for the next academic Year will be $21,000 or 1/4 of the annual salary. The starting salaries go up with inflation and so does the tuition. But you average the starting salaries of All graduating seniors across all majors from that university. Easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you applied to the college, you also had to fill-out a separate form stating that you are requesting financial aid. The college will then require you to fill out the FAFSA forms (which you did) if you are an US applicant, and many colleges also will require the CSS Profile forms. Go online to the college’s financial aid web site and see what they require. Your FAFSA forms will be sent to the college if you listed the colleges’ “ID-numbers” on the FAFSA application. And if you are male, hopefully you already registered with the US Selective Service office or used the FAFSA application process to perform that registration for you. If you did all of that, now you merely wait for the colleges to offer you admission with a financial aid award package. NOTE: Most out-of-state public colleges won’t offer you any financial aid.

Three years of a foreign language is common and four years if you can fit it in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is nearly mid-March and many colleges’ Spring semesters have been in session for 5 to 7 weeks. Therefore, if you just withdrew it is quite possible that your Spring 2020 Federal Pell Grant (not FAFSA, as FAFSA are merely the Forms that you fill out) has been spent by the college. And, since you must apply for financial aid each year, you should have submitted your financial aid forms to your college already and they will use the same formula that they did last year in awarding you a Pell Grant. However, the college Must believe that you are at Least a half-time student who is making progress towards a degree. For that, speak with your faculty adviser and then with a representative at the bursar’s office.

<|startoftext|>I am still a neophyte in many ways, but for me there are two types of financial advisers. Those that merely provide you with advice and you pay them by the hour for the advice. Then you move your money around based upon the advice and your intuition. You will pay at least $100 per hour for the advice. A financial adviser who has control of your investments and moves your investments around to maintain the mix that you have agreed upon and to preserve value as much as possible in a down market and to stick with your increase in value risk in an up market. Those advisers typically take a percentage of the money that they are managing for you. A typical percentage varies for 0.5 percent to 1.3%. You will pay more if you have less money invested. Those are merely guidelines from my experience, and hopefully others will chime in.<|endoftext|>

Therefore, today, they are all test vehicles, and the employee/tester who is a licensed driver and is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle is responsible. At some point, each of the fifty states in the USA and the many Provinces in Canada will have to determine when and how they will allow an “approved” (approval process to be determined) Level 5 vehicle operate on their public roads with No licensed driver responsible for the vehicle.

<|startoftext|>From my knowledge (having Canadian friends who got their bachelors degrees in Canada and then came to the USA and attended MIT for graduate school), the vast majority of Canadian colleges are Large Public universities. Many are excellent and are directly comparable to attending UCLA, Berkeley, U Texas Austin, U Michigan, Penn State and other fine Public colleges in the USA. Because they are so large, they will be much different than attending a MIT or a Dartmouth or a Amherst or a Williams that are elite Private colleges in the USA and range from 2,000 to only 7,000 undergraduate students. Public to Public comparison: Canadian universities are excellent and there is No need to look to the USA. Public to Private: If you believe you will fit in much better with 4,000 peer undergraduates at a small US elite private university then give that some strong consideration After visiting both colleges (public in Canada and the small private elite US college.) Good luck.<|endoftext|>

In answering that previous question you must assure the interviewer that you fully intend to return to your country (leave the USA) after completing your degree and any OPT. Your country can not be on a “do not enter list” and your personal background must be very good So, one out of four is better than nothing. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

At the next level, the Federal government should set strict guidelines by which they will not allow a Private student loan to be erased by personal bankruptcy. Put more burden on the student to Prove to themselves and the private lender that they are Worth the risk. That may mean higher interest rates but then lower default rates. Finally, the Federal government and the state government should be Taxing the overly large endowments of many of the private colleges (relative to the size of their Net annual operating expenses) unless the colleges provide Substantially more financial aid to the current students And any excess should still be taxed and used to assist Public colleges in the USA.

<|startoftext|>No For acceleration to be constant, all of the forces and the mass would have to remain constant. F = ma If one was “falling” from low Earth orbit (let us assume starting at 500,000 feet above mean sea level), the gravitational force will change slightly, increasing as the object approaches the surface of the Earth (mean sea level). That is very slight. The gravitational force is acting towards the center of the Earth (spherical coordinate system). When the object enters the Earth’s atmosphere, there is a drag force that acts opposite the direction of the object’s velocity vector. If the object is descending towards the center of the Earth, then the drag force will counter-act the gravitational force, and the drag force changes with air density and with the velocity of the object. Therefore the net force is F = Fg - Drag (where Fg is the gravitational force) and thus since the drag force changes the net force (F) changes and for a constant mass, the acceleration will change. In addition if the object is moving fast enough, then the drag will cause the surface of the object to heat and that heat may cause some of the surface material to either melt or ablate. In that case, at high velocities, the mass of the object also will diminish. Additionally, for objects of certain shapes, some lift may be generated that is perpendicular to the flight path. That force also will change with air density and the velocity of travel. Enjoy the mechanics of a “falling object”. For low altitudes and velocities one can work in a Cartesian coordinate system. However, many times I have to work in a spherical coordinate system that is centered at the center of the Earth (or Mars, depending upon which atmosphere I am working with and where the object is headed….)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the USA, I believe, the IRS is notified if any one of your winnings is $600 or more. However, you are liable for paying income taxes on All gambling winnings. But, you may deduct all gambling losses (same tax year) from the winnings, but not in excess of the winnings. Therefore, if you win $10,000 from the lottery, the lottery agency will deduct some of the winnings for taxes and will file paperwork with the IRS. Then when you file your taxes for that year, you have the $10,000 as income, and you have pre-paid some taxes. However, you may also deduct gambling losses up to the total of your winnings for that year, for which you have accurate records. This is not legal advice, merely things to consider and to check on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes. That occurred famously in our public school district about 20 years ago. The #2 (by a hair) student in the school had a terrible personality. The letters of recommendation that were written by the guidance counselor (mandatory) and by two teachers requested by the student (for elite Private colleges) all stated what an academically great student the person was, and what a horrible personality the person had……. Needless to say the student was rejected by every college….. Later, we got a group together, convinced the student to have an epiphany and got the student into one of the student’s top choices after the fact. Great lesson. Let that be a lesson to all applicants. Elite private colleges in the USA Mandate a letter of recommendation from the guidance counselor or the head master that describes the applicant over a several year period as both a student and as a whole Person. 75% of getting admitted to an elite Private US college is the great Person (who must also be a great student).

<|startoftext|>Not necessarily. The aerospace company has openings for summer jobs or academic year internships for certain tasks. They are interested in you as a student of engineering.

<|startoftext|>Improve? All I know is that between 7th and 11th grades in public high school, I learned about all of that, plus reading a good newspaper and paying attention to good journalists on TV. Good meaning non-partisan or if they were partisan to listen to others on the “other-side” of the middle. It is there in today’s school system. Our sons learned the same way. That plus good intelligent family discussions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s look around….. In all of the USA, with its huge military investments, large resources, numerous well-trained engineers, there is only Lockheed-Martin as the prime contractor on the F-22A and the F-35 series of jet fighters. Boeing inherited the F-15 and the F/A-18 from McDonnell Douglas when it bought that company. Consolidation. In Europe that consolidation came with the development of the Eurofighter Eurofighter Typhoon - Wikipedia The major aerospace companies across Europe combined to form one co-operative company that would be able to build a great fighter plane and support it across its many world-wide users. It is economic consolidation. Just like the consolidation of the airliner manufacturing business in Europe to Airbus. There is no need for each country to be able to design and manufacturer and then provide life-time support to a few hundred or a thousand fighter planes. Among France and Germany and Great Britain and toss in Italy and Spain, they should be able to figure out the next best consolidation and co-operative process to develop the successor to the Eurofighter Typhoon. Easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you were a 4.0 in college at the end of first term Sophomore year, were in a major that was Not over-subscribed at BU or Fordham, and had $70,000 in cash to pay for each year of BU or Fordham (assuming a high probability of getting little to no financial aid), then you have a High Probability of becoming a junior at those colleges. Trying the same thing at beginning of second term freshman year will lower your chances, plus it will require you to have $210,000 available for three years of college at one of those two colleges rather than only $140,000. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2020 that would be almost impossible. Even an engineering genius and an inspirational leader with a Billion US dollars to invest would not stand much of a chance. It takes tens of Thousands of well trained and experienced engineers of many types and scientists and supply-chain experts and trained technicians to create a viable aerospace industry. Elon Musk, for example, had some great ideas, saw the business opportunity, had the money and was able to create SpaceX. However, at that time, there was an abundance of under-utilized aerospace engineers at McDonnell-Douglas as it was being combined into Boeing, and the space part had lots of IP that was developed with NASA funding many years before. Musk was intelligent enough to realize that the commercialization of space was on the up-swing and there were a lot of engineers and scientists and proven research projects sitting around waiting for investment….. Go into a country with an intelligent population and no aerospace experience and you have a lot of people willing to spend your money to try, but the required infrastructure is HUGE. Why do you think that, for the airline manufacturing business, for aircraft that are A321 or 737-NG or larger, the entire world is dependent upon Airbus and Boeing? And there are dozens of great-idea start-up rocket companies out there, and most are floundering or failing for the few that are succeeding. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am assuming you are applying to be a Freshman: Unless you are a resident of California, Berkeley will be very expensive. However, it has one of the best computer science programs in the USA. You have a shotgun approach across the USA so you may not have considered climate and the region. I grew up in the Snow belt not far from Syracuse University. Unless you love SNOW and cold and wind for more than half of the academic year, do not go to Syracuse University other than to attend a basketball or football game as a visiting spectator. Otherwise a very good college, and my brother loved it for architecture. For subjects like Data Science, I love the Co-Op approach: four years of college (and tuition) spread over 5 years with three six-month paying jobs related to your major interspersed. For that, take a very hard look at Drexel. A fine university in itself, and located directly across the street from UPenn. There are pluses there. Visit and decide for yourself. I personally would head to Georgia Tech over Michigan or Northwestern, because of the underlying STEM center of the university (and because of Atlanta). However, all three are excellent. Find the one that is the best Fit for You. Period. And that includes cost-Effectiveness. If you want to be a Graduate student in Data Science, then find the professor and the research project that is most in-tune with your niche desires. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get out of the Nest. Spread your wings and learn to fly and soar with your peers and not be dependent on your family. Yes, leave and learn and mature and still be a good family person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Graduate school slots are research Jobs. The “employer” (the professors in charge) only wants to know what you can do for their research project and how Fast you can do it, do it well, and present it well both orally and written. However, I believe you will find, from my small sample, that in computer science and mathematics, those universities admit only PhD candidates and not people only interested in a masters degree: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Departments and Areas (Harvard) It is possible that one of the other seven in The Ivy Athletic League will admit in those areas for only a masters. You should check out Stanford, as Stanford was one of the first elite private universities to Go for the Money and offer masters degrees with no thesis for Cash only (no financial aid). Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First the USA is Vast. It is HUGE. The professional sports in the USA may have 24 to 32 total teams per sport. There are Hundreds of colleges scattered across the USA. There are four NCAA D-1 colleges in the city of Boston alone, and their annual ice hockey tournament among the four colleges is hugely attended and fully televised (Harvard, BU, BC and Northeastern). The University of Vermont sells out of season tickets for its men’s ice hockey team…… What else is there to do on those long cold Winter nights in the mountains of Vermont? The local population loves those games. And I seem to remember that it was the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League along with Rutgers and several other older US colleges that truly got college sports going in the USA in the late 1800’s and they were all influenced by the Mantra from the University of Cambridge and Oxford University: Mind and Body: It is difficult to improve one without improving the other. I seem to recollect that Steven Hawking was once on the University of Cambridge crew (rowing) team…… Undergraduate Study (University of Cambridge and sport, see the reference links) Athletics (Oxford) Indeed, if it was primarily the eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League, the NESCAC league, the NEWMAC league, the UAA league, and the Patriot League , we would not be having these discussions. All of those leagues follow the Mantra of Cambridge and Oxford. And over 40% of the undergraduate students at Amherst and Williams colleges (for example) play an intercollegiate sport. But those are not shown on TV that often nor get much coverage in the newspapers. It is the large Public universities that want to raise attention and money for their campuses that have those high profile sports. UCLA has over 30,000 undergraduate students and maybe 800 play an intercollegiate sport….. And most people only care about those athletes that play tackle football and basketball. Those have become the “major-minor-league” teams in the USA and support the NFL and the NBA and bring in lots of MONEY. Who wants to watch a bunch of minor league tackle football players from Tuscaloosa Alabama???? But call that team the University of Alabama and you will put almost 100,000 screaming fans into the stands for home and away games. The USA does not have that Stupid promotion/relegation system where some meaningless D-4 pro team from some no-name town can think it will climb its way to the English Premier league and relegate Liverpool…….. Please. We are realists in the Vast USA. That is why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your female then unless you are looking to be recruited to one of the eight colleges in The Ivy Athletic League, then find a real sport. Female lacrosse is totally watered down. If you are Male, then you play real lacrosse and remember that it started with the Native Americans playing lacrosse instead of having a war. The game was played between two villages, miles apart for the better part of a whole day. At the end they counted the goals, and the dead and wounded to determine a final score. It is a COLLISION sport with your body firmly planted in the turf. In the 1950’s thru the 1980’s college football teams played lacrosse in the Spring to stay in shape…… Jim Brown (NFL all-star and an all-star at Syracuse University in football) was a Lacrosse all-american at Syracuse and he used to run over his opponents…… Learn to catch and throw from both the left and the right. Hours and hours and hours of practice against a wall. Then learn to run over and through people to score. Your body is sacrificed for the greater good of your team. All the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Master’s in biology? What are you going to do with a Master’s in biology? At the top universities, they imply that they want you in a PhD program in biology: Funding - MIT Department of Biology and it is Fully Funded…. Free!!!! Harvard: MCO - Harvard University - Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology same thing… path to a PhD and it is FREE (fully funded) So you only want to be a high school biology teacher or a drone lab technician? Just a master’s, then go across the bridge to Boston and see Boston University: Master of Science (MS) in Biology and you will see there is No funding. They save the full-funding for the PhD students…… Think through this seriously, as there are many people with a PhD in biology who are doing grunt lab work waiting to become a professor or make it in business somewhere……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For female gymnasts, they have made the national team Before leaving high school….. Male gymnasts develop primarily in college, because it is expensive. And then there is No professional gymnastics. What Are All These Famous Gymnasts Doing at a Meet You’ve Never Heard Of? You start to run your own gymnastics club or you go to the circus or become a stunt-person in TV or the movies. Don’t do that. Get a college education and have a much better chance of making something of your after-gymnastics life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t state anything to the college. Your Parents have to sign a Release form that you are living under their supervision. Now the college is absolved of a Lot of responsibility for you as a freshman, and you are off-campus a lot and not gaining the exposure to the other peer students that you should be gaining, and you are probably traveling to/from your apartment during the early hours of the morning or the late hours of the evening, when things may not be too pleasant in the city.,……. Think through all of that, and then let your parents rent out that apartment and you should live on campus…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is the issue: Over half of the applicants to those colleges (and most of the elite private US colleges) can do the academic work. They can attend, survive freshman year, do well in a major and graduate in a timely fashion. More than Half. But for sake of those discussion let us say: Half. The overall admission rate to Harvard or to the special Wharton undergraduate program at UPenn is about 6%. So, now double that to 12%. However, you then have to take out the Legacy admits, and the 16% that are recruited to play varsity sports. So for the non-athlete non-legacy applicant who is much more than academically qualified, the admission rate is still close to 6%….. The recruited student-athlete’s admission rate is greater than 80%. Make certain that your son has some excellent back-up plans. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the USA, most people have One middle name. I know that in some countries, like Argentina, it is common to have many middle names, and two of those middle names are used regularly.

<|startoftext|>From my experience, in the USA, all “residents” or people living in the USA, are allowed to attend the local Public school through senior year of high school.

Check with the public school district in which your guardians live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not? Many colleges have a wide number of sports Clubs and some of those involve the Martial Arts. Work out with a Martial Arts club at your college (that is usually for 8 months per year) and then when you return to your home for the summer (where ever your family is living for that summer) sign-up with a local program in that martial arts, or practice on your own until you return to the college for the Fall term.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When our sons were young, through both of them graduating from college, I carried about $400,000 in term life insurance that cost about $1,400 per year.

<|startoftext|>That was easy. When the eldest was a junior in high school and his brother was a sophomore, we sat them down and stated: We can assist you in attending college, if you wish to attend college. We can afford to pay $XXX per year for each of you to attend college, and that may cover most of a public college. If you want to attend a private college, then you have give us a detailed Plan of why that is more cost-Effective for You, and/or get a lot of scholarship and financial aid money from the private college to make it roughly the same as the Public colleges. NOTE: we expect you to pay $YYY towards your bachelors degree. Period. You can get that from Federal direct loans, and we expect you to have summer jobs and earn money. If you don’t attend college, you may enlist in the military or pursue an apprenticeship. If you pursue an apprenticeship, you must have a Plan if you intend to live at home. We have to approve your plan or you have to move out. Similarly, if after you get your bachelors degree you must have a Plan that is approved by us in order to live at home, or you move out. Period. Worked like a charm. The youngest had a job offer accepted five months before graduating and he was Gone. The eldest had to move home for 6 months to apply for jobs. We approved his plan (which did Not involve rent, but did involve helping around the house) and he then got a job and moved out. Easy. Simple. Show them by Example when they are young how great it is to be Independent, and then sit them down early in junior year of high school (or earlier) and tell them (in general) what we told our sons. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you played a varsity sport in high school (or a high level club sport) and you attend a college that is in the NCAA D-3, then you will explore whether you can try-out for the team. If you attend a NCAA D-2 college, you may contact the coach. If you attend a NCAA D-1 college, then typically the coach has to recruit you. Most of the large state public universities are NCAA D-1 UCLA has 30,000 undergraduate students and less than 900 of those play a NCAA D-1 sport…… I will guess that some of the pick-up soccer games at UCLA are better than many of those high school student’s varsity games in high school (a quote from my two sons who went to NCAA D-1 colleges and laughed at the thought of even asking the coach to try-out). Intramural sports are HUGE on college campuses. Many of those ex-high school athletes become “star” intramural sports athletes at college, and then may join a sport club at college. I believe only about one percent of high school varsity athletes become college varsity athletes across the USA……<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will contact the college and tell the college that you no longer wish to enroll. You will lose your non-refundable deposit and possibly lose a portion of any payments that you made towards the first term. The college should notify the college’s DSO (Designated School Official) who is responsible for the international students. You will contact the DSO (the person/office that sent you the I-20 form that you used to obtain the F-1 visa. I believe you also have a log-in ID for the SEVIS system. You will be fine. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We showed by Example to ours sons to be frugal and live well within your means while still living well. Do you have everything that you Need? Do you need everything that you Have?

<|startoftext|>Many of those colleges that are admitting high school graduates from China, are looking for freshmen who are More than willing to pay $75,000 or more per year for the total cost of studying in the USA.

Federal Student Aid If your father truly can Not afford to pay for your college education, then the Federal government will Give you a Pell Grant that will pay for your complete tuition to attend a local community college, and then assist you when you get automatically transferred to your state’s top public university system as a junior. In that process, your father will Learn what the Federal government (and therefore all US colleges) believe he Can afford to pay towards your college education. If he won’t do that, then your choices are: Work for several years and save up while attending a local community college part-time Enlist in the military and get on-the-job training towards your career and assistance with paying for college.

Unstaffed areas where there may be a “Port-a-Potty” toilet, and most likely not, and mainly a place to park and rest for a few minutes. I rarely used these as they are isolated and could be meeting locations for criminals at night. Sometimes, when I am with my family and it is Day Time and there are others at the rest area, we will stop and eat our sandwiches. But we are always very wary.

<|startoftext|>I took the road test in August of 1968. Our sons took the road test in July 2008 and June 2010. There were two differences all due to the possibility for law suits: In 1968 it was just me and the examiner in the car For our sons with was a son, the examiner and a licensed adult (one of us) Therefore, two seat cars can Not be used for the road test State is worried about being sued by the parents of the applicant or by the applicant. Therefore, there is a witness in the car (in case of an accident) and if there is an immediate failure during the test, the examiner does Not have to drive the car. The other licensed adult in the rear seat gets to switch places with the student taking the test and drive back to the test start point. In 1968 I was required to parallel park behind another real car on a real roadway. For our two sons, they had to parallel park behind some barrels along a curb neat a state building State is worried about damaging a private citizen’s car during the test Other than that it is the same. Lots of driving around and some of that happened to be in a driving rain storm for one of the sons, who just missed killing a stupid pedestrian who jumped out in front of him.

In a congested area or urban area, then the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above anything that is within 2000 feet of the flight path. There is an exception for helicopters that believe they can fly safely lower than that. They should stay above 500 feet at all times, as UAVs can operate up to 400 feet above the surface of the ground. Obviously, once the air ambulance is where it needs to land, it would inform the FAA and the FAA would announce that operation to whomever is paying attention. Watch-out for idiots with UAVs and no sense of awareness.

<|startoftext|>My personal belief is: The Most student loan debt you have when you complete your degree (total loan debt) should not be more than your annual starting salary with that degree. If you firmly believe that You, with that degree in that Major, from that college will be able to earn at Least a $60,000 per year annual salary, then keep your Total loans to less than $60,000. Period. And you should be able to pay them off within ten years. Graduate degrees are different, in that Lawyers and Doctors and Dentists, etc can make over $200,000 per year fairly quickly, and when you get to those levels of earnings, it is much easier to pay off the loans. Also, as a high school senior planning on attending college, do NOT plan on having those large loans. Instead plan on having a total loan upon graduation that is Half of what you expect to earn in an annual starting salary. Half. That allows for “bad things to happen” during college that will increase your total loans to the full amount of your annual starting salary. That advice is easy for STEM majors. It may be very difficult for social workers….<|endoftext|>

Half. Along with all of the others in that undergraduate student community. There have been stories of self-taught geniuses who entered college at 15, graduating at age 17 with a bachelors degree and Then attending MIT as a graduate student or going somewhere else for a PhD and then becoming a professor at MIT.

The CSS profile forms ask for everything that is on the FAFSA forms, plus a lot of information on your parents’ home value and all other types of assets. Indeed, many private colleges will also look very hard at any of your sibling’s bank accounts and assets if they are under the age of 14, as your family could hide money with your younger siblings. And if your parents own a small business, then the colleges will look very hard at that since it is Assumed that families are hiding money in those businesses. Consider the elite private US colleges to be very generous with up to and including full financial aid, but they investigate everything and are like large Vacuum cleaners and will suck everything that they can from your assets and your parents’ assets.

Also, there are expenses involved with obtaining a F-1 student visa that you will have to pay. On top of that, you are expected to work each summer after a year of attending MIT, and MIT will expect you to make at least $3,000 each of those three summers to contribute towards your overall cost or attendance.

Now the college sees the complete income of the student and reduces the financial aid Grant even further… That happened to one of my sons as he entered senior year of college and what was a $14,000 financial aid Grant, was reduced each year until finally as he entered senior year it went to ZERO.

<|startoftext|>I have successfully contested two types of tickets: Parking tickets Running a “yellow light” in California In each case, I did that by either phone, e-mail or US mail. Why go to court if you can easily prove your case remotely??? Parking tickets: You have to prove that they have the Wrong vehicle. The parking ticket is supposed to list the license plate number, and the make and model and color of the vehicle. In two cases they screwed up the license plate number and my car did Not match the vehicle that got the original ticket. Both cases were dismissed easily In the third case, we had sold the car, and three months later it gets a parking ticket at a state public college. However, they screwed up and scanned the “inspection sticker” to determine that it was our car, and when they fully checked, they realized that the student who bought the car from a used car lot did not get it re-inspected as they were supposed to. Easily dismissed with an apology to us Traffic ticket I got the running a yellow light ticket in San Francisco when I lived in Los Angeles and was in San Francisco on business. I certainly was not going back to San Francisco to contest a $100 ticket. I immediately wrote a check for $100 to the traffic clerk and sent a two-page letter detailing everything that occurred and why I should not have been ticketed. The clerk cashed the check, read the letter, talked with the police officers and then sent me a letter apologizing for the ticket and included a check for $85 to me with the $15 held by the traffic court as an expense fee. Ticket was dismissed. Nice. Merely: address the traffic clerk or parking clerk as soon as possible with a complete and detailed explanation. For the traffic ticket, I included full payment. For the parking tickets they all dismissed the summons for late payment (with fines) to me (since I never received the original ticket) and apologized for the error. So: Traffic ticket: Pay it in Full and include a detailed letter. You may be found innocent as I was. Parking ticket late summons: Contact the parking clerk and explain why it was Not your car/vehicle. However, if you did get a parking ticket or traffic ticket, then PAY THE TICKET immediately and include an explanation if there is one, and Maybe you will get it dismissed and sent a refund. They do Not want to see you in traffic court. That is time and money for the court and the police. It is rare to win there. Instead Pay the ticket and send the court clerk a detailed explanation. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It does Not matter if they saved or not. In the USA, the Federal and State governments and all of the colleges believe and mandate that the Primary source of payment for a child’s undergraduate college education be the Parents. While they may not have specifically saved, they may have to: Treat your college costs like a “second mortgage” and scrape up $1,200 per month to assist in paying for college for you Actually re-mortgage their house to tap into any accumulated increased equity in the property to pay for your college education If your parents completely refuse to assist, then you can: Pay for a community college for two years yourself, assuming your parents allow you to continue living at home Then do extremely well and get admitted under a state guaranteed program as a junior in your state’s top public university system NOTE: If your parents will at least fill-out the FAFSA forms with you, you may qualify for $6,000 in a Pell Grant (free money to you) per year for four years and also qualify for some scholarship money from your state’s top public university system for the last two years. Using the FAFSA forms info, you can also borrow up to $27,000 over four years from the Federal Direct Loan program. With all of that and not a dime from your parents you should be able to get a bachelors degree with a reasonable student loan debt (less than $35,000 total). And if you can’t start a job with a bachelors degree for at Least $40,000 per year why are you in college in that major???

<|startoftext|>Why? If you have to ask the question then you can’t afford the cost of attending U Michigan and not being a resident of the state of Michigan. That is what my sons learned when they were applying to colleges. We could afford Some out-of-state colleges but not all. And if they attend a Private college, then they needed to get the cost down to that “affordable number” via merit scholarships plus some financial aid. NOTE: They both were Required by us to take a Minimum of $18,000 in Federal Direct Student Loans (graduating in 2013 and 2014), so today it will be closer to $25,000 out of the maximum $27,000 you can affordably borrow from the Feds. So, here is U Michigan: Costs | Undergraduate Admissions and here is U Delaware. Cost of Attendance | University of Delaware which is about $14,000 per year less expensive for an out-of-state student. And I claim you can do just as well there. Close to Philadelphia and New York City and to Baltimore. Both colleges are Blue. Michigan are wolverines and Delaware are Fighting Blue Hens….. (the “fighting” part makes the mascot more palatable) The point is that there are Excellent public universities in other states and one does Not have to go out-of-state to Texas or Michigan or California to get a great education at a Public university. Delaware (for example) is $60,000 less expensive than attending Michigan…… over four years. And easy to get to via any of the major cities…… Look at University & College Search Tool and find cost-Effective colleges for you and do Not fixate on Wolverines.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For the USA. It will depend upon the age spread. Our sons are 15 months apart and we only had two. They were one year apart in school, so most of the time they were in the same schools which makes picking them up and dropping them off easy and inexpensive. They were both boys and played on the same sports teams most of the time. Therefore, we didn’t have to go to two different soccer fields in two different towns to bring our sons to their games. They were on the same teams. With two, we did Not need to change our cars nor get a bigger house. With one child, almost any house will do. With four children you may very well need a bigger house which means more money. If they are close in age, it may be Impossible for the six of you to go anywhere together without buying a Monster SUV or Minivan due to child seat requirements. If they are four years apart, you will have a continuous stream entering and being in college. Whereas, if they are a year apart, then they will be in college over-lapping BUT private colleges may give you more financial aid….. And DO NOT think that you will Not pay for their college if they want to go to college and can thrive in college. In the USA the federal and state governments and all of the colleges Believe and Mandate that the Parents are the primary source of paying for a child’s undergraduate education. Period. With four, assuming two boys and two girls that are each two years apart and alternating (girl, boy, girl, boy) they will all be on different teams/activities and you will be spending all of your time paying for that and getting them to/from their independent activities. You will need different cars/vehicles. You may need a bigger house or have to expand your current house. Four children could be More than 4 times as expensive as one child and more than two times as expensive as two children. You may not be able to use hand-me-down clothing and some of the toys may change. Our sons played with the same toys and video games. Makes it cheaper. My Personal belief is: If you can physically have two children, then have two children and Do Not stop at one. However, once you have two children (18 to 30 months apart), then STOP and truly think it through to have more. Having more than two could be a life-style changer. Unless you live on a farm and you need eight children to assist in tending the flocks the herds and tilling the soil…… Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In general, neither parents income nor assets will influence the award of a Merit scholarship or an Athletic scholarship. Therefore, we are discussing, for the USA, the influence of parents income and assets on a college’s willingness to provide Financial Aid (Grants, i.e. giving money away) to the college student. Any student (regardless of family wealth) can get a Federal Direct loan. However, with a lot of wealth, most if not all of the loans will be unsubsidized (interests starts to accumulate immediately upon dispersal of the funds to the college). Colleges love to hoard money……….. Otherwise Harvard would not have $40 Billion in endowment money and could not have afforded to buy the Watertown Arsenal with “pocket change”. But, to appease Congress, those wealthy colleges are trying to show that they are Giving money to needy students (trying to prevent a sizable tax on large endowments) Here is my understanding: There is an amount that a family is allowed to have in liquid assets that do not affect college-provided financial aid. That used to be $60,000 and it may be a bit more now. Whereas, any money in the Student’s name is fair game for the college to reduce financial aid. My son lost several thousands of dollars in financial aid going into senior year, because he had earned a lot of money in the summer before junior year. Colleges will look at family income and at how many children you have, and how many of those children are currently in college. Having several children in college at the same time may increase the financial aid provided by a good Private college to one or more of the children. I believe that having any children in private high schools or boarding schools will be “looked down upon” by the colleges while deciding financial aid for a sibling. While I did not try this (didn’t have the liquid assets to do it at the time) this Might work: Two or More years prior to your oldest child starting college, give money to your parents or spouse’s parents and have them open a 529 account in the name of your child. The grandparents do Not give any of that 529 money to the child until the child is getting ready to enter senior year of college, and afterwards (assisting with paying off Federal and other student loans). Grandparents’ wealth/assets are Not counted. However, you have to file each year in February/March to get financial aid for the next year. If the grandparents start to provide money to the child during freshman or sophomore or first term junior year, it will be discovered…. Of course you have to Trust your parents or your spouse’s parents…… And if you do those “gifts” within two years of the child starting college, it will be found out……………… That is the only way I know to “beat the system” The colleges through the FAFSA application forms will require copies of your Federal tax returns for the previous year or two. And if you own a small business, the college will have investigators all over that with a fine tooth comb looking for hidden money. And a friend of mine, whose oldest daughter was applying for financial aid as a college freshman, had a younger brother under the age of 14. The private colleges Demanded full view of that younger brother’s bank accounts and any assets in his name (a typical place for a family to hide cash) before granting any financial aid……. And if you are required to fill out the CSS Profile forms, and most private colleges require those to filled out annually, then the college will assume you will draw down on the “money in your home”. If your home has appreciated, then the college wants you to use some of that appreciation to fund your child’s college education…… Each and every year you will fill out all of those FAFSA and CSS Profile forms and submit copies of your Federal Tax returns…… And, typically, while the cost of attending college goes up each year, the amount of financial aid provided by the college typically does Not go up each year and may go Down for junior and senior years……………… What are you going to do? Transfer out???? They have you by the “short hairs” so to speak……. Our sons were 15 months apart and graduated college in 2013 and 2014. We remortgaged our home twice and extracted money to pay for college, and when I made the last payment for the second son, our bank account was very close to ZERO. The private colleges are Very Good at using vacuum cleaners to get every dime that They Believe that you have. Oh………………… The youngest, turned down $2,000 in unsubsidized Federal Direct loan as a freshman, but took the $3,500 subsidized Federal direct loan. He had been given a $14,000 grant by the college as a freshman. However, as a sophomore that was Lowered to $12,000………………….. Because he refused that $2,000 unsubsidized Federal loan the year before……………………… Be careful. Be VERY careful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There are two types of after-school sports programs: The private ones that use a sports activity for day-care from 3pm to 6pm when the parent arrives to pick-up the child. Those are in lieu of day care but are day care for the 6 to 12 year old students. If it is a private for-profit business, then you may have to seek an alternative The school sports for the 13 to 18 year old middle and high school students. In every town that I am aware of, there are a “means-test” for what you and your family can afford and if you pass the test you may qualify for reduced price or free lunches and for free after-school school sports. A typical school sport in my town costs about $200 for a 10 week season. The child could earn money by baby-sitting, pet-sitting, and (as they get older) refereeing/umpiring youth sports. $20 per week should be easy for a 13+ year old teenager to make in order to afford the sports program while still saving for after high-school expenses (college, launching an apprenticeship or enlisting in the military). Of course, we had one basic rule in our family: One sport per season. Period. That saves money and time.<|endoftext|>

Of course admission rates are really a function of the number of available slots for students at Harvard and the number of people who apply. Since Harvard has been more accommodating of the poor (financial aid) and has a wide diversity of students including many females and wide array of ethnicities and religions, there are more and more high school students applying to be freshmen, but Harvard only has room for roughly 1,650 freshmen each year.

So, my parents looked at the Big Picture of attending college, and as long as I was working and contributing to paying for college, there was no need to charge me “rent” during those two summers. Same for our sons. One started a job immediately upon graduating from college and the other needed six months to work part-time while finding a full-time job as a mechanical engineer.

May 1975 and the Soviet Union and the USA are having the first exchange of ships/sailors since World War II. Height of the cold war. MIT soccer coach is approached to play a soccer game against the Soviet sailors at MIT. He agrees but very few people realize that this is going to occur. I am a high school and USSF soccer official and in the midst of preparing to become a college soccer official, and I am an assistant soccer coach for the team. The head coach asks me to referee. I find another graduate student with whom I have played soccer and refereed soccer (teaching him that art) who is also skilled in speaking Russian. We are to work a dual system that was common in the USA at that time. The day before the game, suddenly the game itself has become a Huge thing. Hours before the game I am called into the main offices of MIT and told how big this will be. Height of the cold war and US and Soviet Union will be playing soccer against each other in the USA…………………………………………. No time to get more experienced referees, we will have to do, and Do Well…… We go to the field and there are more Soviet and US Admirals and high ranking officers ringing the field than anyone else, and it is standing room only…. We all exchange token gifts with each other, and the two gifts I received 45 years ago are still displayed in my office. When we see the two teams we are relieved. The Soviet sailors seem younger than the MIT varsity athletes. It was an up and down game with lots of calls and we handled it well and the players enjoyed the competition, and fittingly after 90 minutes it was a 1–1 tie. Everyone was happy. Our pictures were emblazoned on the front of the Boston Globe newspaper the next day and I like to think that I was part of one small step towards detente. I have officiated many “bigger” games, but never one so important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From my experience with international college students, there are several options: Stay with a close friend’s family in the USA at their home Arrange with the college to stay in a dormitory during the Winter Break. MIT always had a dorm open to accommodate anyone who could not go “home” for the Winter break Arrange with your parents to meet you at a nice vacation place in the USA for Winter break and have them pay for the hotel expenses All three are common. Merely substitute Fall or Spring break for Winter break. However, the Summer break is much longer, and for that you should get a summer job related to your major (OPT) and rent a place to live near the job. Many fraternities and sororities will rent out their building for the summer to those types of students.<|endoftext|>

I agree with the law suit. As far as I know, there is No requirement for high school male Children who think they are female to Have to go through mandatory sex change medical procedure prior to competing in school sports. Whereas, at the college level, a minimum one year medically supervised transformation is Mandatory per the NCAA for NCAA sports. Here is the NCAA handbook: https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Transgender_Handbook_2011_Final.pdf The high school athletic association of CT should send an official certificate to any biologically female track & field or cross country or swimming or tennis or golf, etc. athlete who made it to the top ten in their field and were beaten by a transfemale male Child.

<|startoftext|>In the USA the four year colleges feel a special responsibility to assist the freshmen in adjusting from living under the supervision of their parents or at a strict boarding school to the freedom and individual responsibility that comes with being an adult at that college. Therefore, every four year US college that I am aware of Requires that freshmen must live either in college provided housing or live with their parents or legal guardians. Once sophomore year rolls around, they are free to live where ever they desire to live. However, many colleges are in expensive areas, and even most sophomores and juniors would rather stay in the conveniently located dormitories or independent student living groups. It is something that you should cherish and not try to avoid.<|endoftext|>

I would advise arriving looking like a tourist and simply and succinctly telling the agent your tourist (B2) or business (B1) itinerary. Keep it simple. I would assume that your F1 visa was rejected because you couldn’t show the State Department staff member that you have sufficient funds outside of the USA to pay for two years of what the college’s I-20 form shows you will be expected to pay.

<|startoftext|>Typically, one is “assigned” a room mate for your dorm room as a freshman. After that, a group of room mates get together and request a dorm assignment as “upperclassmen” And that is where the RA (Residence Assistant) or some one like me (Judicial Committee member/chairman) enters the picture. We didn’t have RAs at MIT when I was there. Instead we had a judicial committee that was appointed by the dorm’s elected officers. I was on the committee as a sophomore and as a junior and then chairman as a senior (chairman is always a senior). We did the room assignments for the following school year at the end of one school year (why the senior is in charge) and we adjudicated any issues during the school year. If there were room mate problems then we stepped in and “took care of it”, which could mean moving people around within the dorm or “Just laying down the Law for common sense and respect”. Easy. RAs I believe are much more limited… Too bad. Therefore, no one ever had a Bad room mate for more than a few days…… Not in our dorm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First it would be creating enough high-grade material for the fission portion of all nuclear weapons. Second would be testing the design to assure that it works. Third would be installing and maintaining high grade security measures to assure that the nuclear weapons are only used as the highest level of the country’s government determines they should be used. That is why the Ukraine (when the Soviet Union broke up) went from the #3 country in the world with nuclear weapons to Zero. It did Not want the hugely expensive responsibility for safeguarding the weapons and allowed the USA and Russia to remove all of the weapons and convert the material for use in nuclear power plants (I believe Japan got a lot of that fuel).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be while I was a student in a public school (K-12) There were several: For certain infractions, the student had detention with the janitors and cleaned the floors and walls.

Never had a student expelled nor suspended from one of our public schools, because we had Real discipline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. That would be Unsporting. Period. The player would be cautioned and the restart would be an indirect free kick from where that player is when the referee stops play.

<|startoftext|>Former student??? For my answer, the Student would have to be at Least 18 years old (an Adult in the USA) and no longer at that school. Therefore, if a high school teacher, who taught the student as a junior, started to date the student when the student is in College or Working (gone from the high school) that would be fine.

<|startoftext|>I made certain that we had more than adequate life insurance polices to be able to pay for our two sons to attend and complete college.

However, in college, per NCAA rules, any male who wishes to transition to a female Must undergo a minimum of a year’s medical transitioning under the supervision of a licensed medical doctor before being able to compete as a woman in a NCAA event. Therefore, those high school students should compete as Males until they can undergo the proper and Mandatory medical transition to be a female athlete.

<|startoftext|>Our sons graduated high school in 2009 and 2010 to put things into perspective. The summer after 5th grade they each went to a local two-week day camp that cost $600 for the session. They got into a car-pool group as parents dropped them off and picked them up. Prior to that they each attended two-week in-town soccer day camps and tennis day camps. Reasonably priced ($120 per week for half-day) When they were in middle school they went together to a two-week fire-fighters camp at the local fire department where they learned all about fire fighting and first aid. That was free. Starting the summer after 6th grade, for five summers, they each attended YMCA Camp Belknap in New Hampshire for two weeks. That was, then, $500 for the two week session, each. Cost has gone up but it is still the best deal around New England. Additionally, when they were entering sophomore/junior (together) they became camp counselors in training for two weeks at a local day camp run by a private school and then for two years worked as camp counselors for that two week session. Highly recommend a two-week local day camp starting the summer after Kindergarten, all the way through high school (where they become workers in high school) and a two-week camp deep in the woods with No Technology and No communication back home. Excellent for preparing them for real life, and for going away to college. They both knew that we would pick them up after two weeks, whether at the camp or at a hospital, but to enjoy the experience. Excellent!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Both for colleges and a state’s public school system they are one week long. Colleges usually do that in March. High schools in the Northeast are usually in April. Massachusetts celebrates Patriots Day on a Monday in April, and that week is the public school Spring break. I believe New Hampshire and Connecticut (adjoining states) use the week before and the week after so that the airports don’t get clogged with family travelers. Also, during junior year the high school students and their families will visit colleges to figure out which college is a good fit for the applicant. Then in senior year they will visit the colleges to which they were admitted to make a final determination on which college in which to enroll. Therefore, most college Spring Breaks are over by the end of the first week of April. Coordination works well. Additionally, some college sports, like baseball, will use Spring Break in the Northeast to go South to play games. March is good for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s February in the USA To make it meaningful, most schools will have you spend an hour walking up and down between home plate and first base on the school’s baseball field.

<|startoftext|>When I was a freshman at MIT, my room mate (double room) Spring term was a junior physics major from an historically black college in North Carolina. He was an excellent student at his college, and he had that “exchange” term to prove himself at MIT. He worked hard and the courses were hard, but he did it. Then, after his senior year at his college in North Carolina he came back to MIT as a fully-funded PhD student in physics. If you have the opportunity to study at an elite private US college for a term or a year, then Take the opportunity. It can open up doors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In general, no real challenges We already have demonstrated that we can build a blended wing (flying wing) aircraft: So, here is an image of a blended wing airliner: How will you demonstrate that you can evacuate all of the passengers of that airliner within 90 seconds with half of the exit doors blocked and half of the exit slides unusable? Looking at that picture, I can imagine 300 passengers and flight crew on that aircraft. I can not imagine a way to get all 300 out of that blended wing airplane in less than 90 seconds with assuming only one-half of the exits are usable. Other than that? Easy. The B-2A flight crew have ejection seats……<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Typically, if someone is injured and needs an ambulance, the call would go to emergency services (911) and the local police would arrive with the ambulance or the fire department would accompany the ambulance (depending). While the adult is being cared for and prepared to be placed into the ambulance, the police would be contacted to arrive and arrange for the child to be cared for. If the adult is conscious, then the adult can inform the first responders of who to contact to care for the children. If some of the children are old enough, then they can tell the first responders whom to contact. The children will never be left alone. The local police will start the process of seeking care for the children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From the small offices I have worked in or with, and assuming each of the 4 to 5 people is doing the work expected of them: Do you have too much office space?

Get a VOIP (voice over internet protocol) phone system and only pay for what you need. Many small businesses pay too much for phones How are you doing file back-up on your computer system? Utilities: Is your office “too warm” in the winter and “too cool” in the summer? Set guidelines for how much you heat and cool your office. That can be a major savings. People should wear a light sweater in the Winter and keep the office at 71 deg F and in the summer do Not cool below 76 deg F. You will be surprised at what you save.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allow a player to appear in each half of a game, once. Therefore, a player can leave the game in the 1st half, and then re-enter the game in the 2nd half. Similarly, if there are over time periods. Once per period. Obviously this is for the high level soccer which currently has extremely limited substitution rules. This way, a team can have 17 players (two goal keepers and 15 field players). And with the “once per period” rule for being an on-field player, this would allow for more games per week without over-stressing the players. It also allows an injured “star-player” a chance to come into a future game for a while to get back into “game shape” and for the fans to see that player, even if only for 15 minutes per half. Also, I would limit the use of VAR and Not use it for an offside determination, Unless the AR on that side requests assistance. Otherwise, the Laws of the Game are fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You are assuming that children of middle class or low-income families could never be legacy? They can be, and sometimes are and are treated as legacy depending upon the college (MIT and Caltech do Not consider legacy). And many colleges also give a “boost” to first-time students in a family. Also, many/most legacy applicants who are accepted have more than sufficient academic prowess to be accepted on their own merits.

<|startoftext|>In the USA, you are not allowed to take a car off a new or used car sales lot without license plates and registration. And, in many states, you can’t get a registration and license plates until you have an auto insurance policy. Therefore, put-down a down payment to hold the car, get an auto insurance policy and then have the car sales company get the registration and license plates for you (nominal fee), as the insurance companies handle almost everything online today. Easy. If you are buying a car on a private sale, then have an insurance policy first, tell the insurance company which car you are buying and then check with your state’s registry of motor vehicles how you should handle the sales transaction to get a registration in your name and new license plates. Super easy.<|endoftext|>

However, many public schools rent their facilities to religious groups to use during non-school time. So the teacher could rent the school for the evening or the weekend.

NOTE: For example, if you are taking an airport provided shuttle bus or train to/from the rental car company, then items left on the bus/train are at one lost and found and items left in the car are at the rental car company’s lost & found. And, unfortunately, if it is a nice jacket or hat or gloves, then it may be found by someone who decides Not to turn it over to lost & found. Happened to me at a rental car company in Albuquerque. It is best to try and not get distracted and to keep your possessions in sight. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a gimmick to me. Something to encourage international students to spend money to pursue. If you attend a college like Northeastern or Drexel University you get a five year program with four years of tuition Plus three six-month Paying Co-Op jobs (CPT) that are related to your major. And you still get your full OPT. Additionally, there is No restriction for an international student to work 20 hours per week On Campus. There are a Lot of on-campus jobs for needy students. Don’t waste your time (or any money) exploring Day 1 CPT. Indeed, it would be very difficult for a college to prove that “Day 1” CPT is educationally useful for any student and it is even more suspicious to the US Federal government if it is primarily for “international students”….. Additionally, you may Not use the possibility of earning any money in the USA to qualify for a F-1 student visa. You must show the US Department of State staff member that you have (in cash in the bank) the full amount of money required for you to pay that university and live in the area (per the I-20 form), plus the money to buy a round-trip ticket, plus liquid assets that will more than pay for your second year at that college.

<|startoftext|>Yes, if you can over come a couple of issues. Not being an US citizen is Not a problem. However, in the USA, each state’s laws governs these issues. You could buy the car in Florida (“cash” transaction with No loan), but then you have to Register the car to be able to drive the car. To register the car, you need a residence in that state. So, there are two ways of doing this: Under your visa (not a tourist visa) establish a residence in Florida, buy the car and register it there, and then leave Florida, drive to California where you establish residence there and use the car for nine months. But then you would need a Florida drivers license and a California drivers license…. Establish residence in California and arrange from California to buy the car in Florida where you are visiting for a few days. You would take the California registration and license plates with you and then drive the car back to California (this option makes the most sense). NOTE: An US citizen can fly to Europe, pick-up a car that they arranged to buy in their home state, drive it around Europe for six months while on vacation and then have it shipped back to the USA. Check with a car dealer in South Korea to see if you can pre-arrange that before you come to the USA for your one year visit. There are ways, but it will take a lot of Pre-planning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes/Maybe…… Assuming that a much larger launch vehicle could give the shuttle sufficient velocity to get to the Moon and orbit the moon or if the Shuttle could have some how been refueled in Earth orbit. The biggest thing that limits long voyages is the amount of time (batteries, food, etc) that can be carried on the space craft. The shuttle had taken five astronauts for an almost 18 day mission STS-80 - Wikipedia Put a lander in the payload bay, and figure out how to refuel the shuttle, and I believe one could get the shuttle to Moon orbit, send two astronauts to the Moon’s surface in a lander, return to the Shuttle after several days take the lander back into the shuttle bay, return to Earth orbit and then de-orbit and land. That would have been a fun exercise. The tricky thing would have been the refueling the shuttle in low Earth orbit.

<|startoftext|>A learners permit is Not a license. If you are alone, then you are an unlicensed driver. You will be arrested and brought to the police station, while the car is towed to the police impound lot. The owner of the car will be contacted to come to the police station and get a document allowing the owner to claim the car at the impound lot (for a Lot of money). You will be able to post-bail and then find a way home. If you are under the age of 18, your learners permit will be Revoked and you will start from scratch. Most likely, under 18, you will need to attend another few sessions of a special drivers education class for a Lot of money. Do NOT do that.<|endoftext|>

So, as a coach, if I have an injured player and can not reach the family in a reasonable time, I can have emergency services rendered to the child, as the family has authorized it in allowing the child to participate in our league. But if you are 15 years old, and gash yourself while skate-boarding and get to an urgent care facility or emergency room on your own……. I believe the staff will clean the wound while trying to reach the parents or legal guardian, and then Maybe stitch the wound if they can’t reach the parent/guardian.

<|startoftext|>Personally, I have “witnessed” many more severe injuries at the same level of football as ice hockey but I have no statistics. The data below is for concussion rates per sport: These things have to be contrasted on a sport by sport comparison for a similar level of player. Here is some data that was gathered on high school sports, referenced first here: Study: Concussion rates in high school football games rising “…Rates of recurrent concussions declined during the study period. They were highest among boys’ ice hockey, boys’ lacrosse and girls’ field hockey. Results also showed females had higher concussion rates than males in the same sport…” It references this study: ————————- prelude ———————- …This study describes the epidemiology of concussions in 20 high school sports during the 2013–2014 to 2017–2018 school years. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiology study, a convenience sample of high school athletic trainers provided injury and athlete exposure (AE) data to the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School Reporting Information Online). Concussion rates per 10 000 AEs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and distributions were calculated. Injury rate ratios and injury proportion ratios examined sex differences in sex-comparable sports (soccer, basketball, baseball and softball, cross country, track, and swimming). We also assessed temporal trends across the study period. RESULTS: Overall, 9542 concussions were reported for an overall rate of 4.17 per 10 000 AEs (95% CI: 4.09 to 4.26). Football had the highest concussion rate (10.40 per 10 000 AEs). Across the study period, football competition-related concussion rates increased (33.19 to 39.07 per 10 000 AEs); practice-related concussion rates decreased (5.47 to 4.44 per 10 000 AEs). In all sports, recurrent concussion rates decreased (0.47 to 0.28 per 10 000 AEs). Among sex-comparable sports, concussion rates were higher in girls than in boys (3.35 vs 1.51 per 10 000 AEs; injury rate ratio = 2.22; 95% CI: 2.07 to 2.39). Also, among sex-comparable sports, girls had larger proportions of concussions that were recurrent than boys did (9.3% vs 6.4%; injury proportion ratio = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.88). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of football practice-related concussions and recurrent concussions across all sports decreased. Changes in concussion rates may be associated with changes in concussion incidence, diagnosis, and management. Future research should continue to monitor trends and examine the effect of prevention strategies. —————— End of abstract and it costs money to get the full paper ———- and this study: Concussion Rates per Sport The below numbers indicate the amount of sports concussions taking place per 100,000 athletic exposures.

<|startoftext|>Not certain what you are referring to. What are the maximum penalties possible in a sudden death playoff in soccer? First, under FIFA laws of the game, a game that is in OT must play the full 30 minutes of extra time (both 15 minute halves) before a winner is decided, so it is Not sudden death. The maximum penalty is still a disqualification of a player on the field of play (the red card is displayed to indicate that). A team must be able to field 7 players to continue to play. If, through injuries and dismissals, a team, at any time during the game, can not field seven field players, the game is Over. The league or association will determine a winner. However, if a player is being treated for an injury (having not been substituted for), then the referee will allow a reasonable amount of time for that player to return to the game before terminating the game for having too few players. Once the two 15 minute OT periods have been played, the two teams will alternate taking Kicks from the Mark (proper terminology). Each team takes five kicks from the mark and after each has taken five the referee will determine if there is a winner. If the game is still tied, then each team will take one more kick and the ref will determine a winner after each has kicked. If still tied, that continues For Ever, until a winner is determined or the game has to be abandoned for weather, lack of light or the expiration of the permit for the field. Where upon the league/association will determine what to do then. When the kicks from the mark are taken, only the eleven players on the field at the end of the second OT can participate, unless the team has a substitute available (only three for the entire game or in some competitions a fourth is allowed for the OT). If one team has 10 players and the other has 11 players, then the team with 11 will remove one to be equivalent to the other team. Those players continue to take kicks from the mark. In the case of 11 players on each team, all eleven must kick before anyone can take a second kick. After eleven kicks have been taken by each team, then the order of the kickers can be switched for the next eleven, and it continues in groups of eleven (or ten or nine depending upon the numbers of players available.). The game could be determined on the 35th kick or the 135th kick, but it keeps going (after five) one at a time until there is a winner. Easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So how does the US Department of State staff member know that you applied to 16 US universities to be admitted to a Master program? How many acceptances did you get? Each acceptance would generate an I-20 form which you must use to enter the SEVIS system and start the F-1 visa process Students and the Form I-20 You enter that system with One I-20 form, the one from the college that you accepted. You don’t enter with 16 I-20 forms….. Or did you get 16 offers of admittance each with its own I-20 form, which of course would not look good on your account. Hopefully, you only got a few acceptances and you choose the best for you and apply for the F-1 visa. When interviewed, stick to why you want a Masters and if asked, merely discuss the colleges that Admitted you and why you chose that one college. Easy and truthful. The key is: Why that major? Why a Masters? Why that college? and what are you going to do with that degree for your career when you RETURN to your home country. Period.

And also note, that the customs and border patrol (CBP) agents who will talk with you when you try to enter the USA, work for a different Federal agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

However, the state started to run into trouble with a litigious society of parents in the USA: What happens of the person taking the driving test does something stupid and flunks the test?

Or if the person taking the road test had an accident, then the owner of the car may sue claiming that the tester contributed to the accident. This way, there is an adult who is properly seated in the rear seat as a witness and if the person taking the test flunks by doing something bad, they are instructed to pull over, and then the adult in the rear seat (with a valid license) drives the car back to the starting point to drop off the tester.

<|startoftext|>It is very similar (human presence) as the Earth’s South Pole - Wikipedia The South Pole was visited by humans in 1911 and then not again until the late 1950’s. Too isolated, too expensive, too harsh an environment and no practical reason to. Those 12 NASA astronauts spent very little time on the surface of the Moon for the expense of going there. And until recently, there have been very few successful landings of anything on the Moon. Expense and complexity. It might cost close to a Billion dollars (today) for one trip of three humans to the Moon for a few days, and that is probably way too low for the cost estimate. And what is the return on that investment? Economics 101………… Private companies/entities are not allowed to claim anything in space (Moon, Mars, etc.). There will be a quarantine on anything returned from space. There must be a reason. Come up with a good reason that someone will fund, and Maybe….. In 1976 I worked with a group of MIT students on a much longer than one-term project sponsored by NASA to arrive at an engineering design of a 1,000 person worker colony at the L-5 libration point that would use materials from the Moon to start building very large space-colonies. Just the cost for that was $180 Billion of 1980 dollars (with the Saturn V still available and no where near the fear of failure that NASA inherited from the Challenger disaster) over an 18 year period. But there was no real justification for it, and no one wanted to pay for it. Now, 48 years later (Apollo 17 - Wikipedia ) it is like 1959 again and the South Pole. It is interesting and technology is available to make it easier to do, and there may be a valid scientific reason. Of course, the cost is much higher now after the Challenger accident….. In 1969 we were prepared to lose two astronauts on the surface of the Moon. I am not certain if NASA or the US or Russia are prepared to lose astronauts or cosmonauts who are Explorers….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you are asking this question because you have been recruited to play NCAA soccer in the USA or are strongly considering it. As a college soccer referee I meet a lot of international students playing college soccer. This past Fall (2019), I was on a D-1 college referee crew and of the 22 starting male players that were introduced pre-game (both teams), not a single one was from the USA. There are a lot of international students playing college soccer in the USA. However, all of the successful ones that I am aware of are in the USA to get a college education and then to possibly get into a very good graduate degree program. Many years ago, I remember an excellent soccer player at Boston University who was from England. When asked if he was planning on playing pro soccer in the USA after graduation, he looked at the reporter and laughed. “If I wanted to play pro soccer, I would have stayed in England and made a team at 18 years old. I am here for the great college education.” The key is balancing your time and energy. Remember that you are a Student-athlete and only attend a college that will support the Student portion. Also, soccer players are Not given full athletic scholarships: College Athletic Scholarship Limits Male players divide 9.9 full scholarships among the players on the team, so you will be lucky to get 50% financial aid (all expenses). And the female players get to divide 14 full scholarships among all of the team’s players (probably full-tuition assistance). It can be a great way of getting an excellent college education. Especially those that leverage their soccer skills to get admitted to an elite Private US college like one of the eight in The Ivy Athletic League or Stanford, Duke, etc. NOTE: The eight colleges of The Ivy Athletic League, do not award any athletic scholarships. However, you can get up to and including full financial aid after you and all of your parents fill-out the CSS Profile forms each year.

<|startoftext|>By being realistic about accumulating student loan debt in order to earn a bachelors degree. Including getting that degree within Four years. It is those 5th and 6th years that are killers for debt (unless they are in a 5 year Co-Op bachelors degree program and those are economically GREAT). My rule of thumb is: Do Not Plan on borrowing more than $27,000 over the four years it takes to earn a bachelors degree (total). That is the maximum one can borrow from the great Federal direct loan program. Both of our sons each graduated with $25,000 in Federal student loan debt after four years of college, started jobs with annual salaries of slightly more than $60,000 per year and were able to pay off their total loans in under 5 years. Easy. If you believe you will need more than $27,000 in total loans Before starting as a freshman, then come up with a different plan. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, there are no real high school sports at the National level, except for track & field and cross country. I know there is a cross country national championship each year, I believe in San Diego. Similarly, I know that there are regional and I believe national indoor track championships for high school students. But for other sports it is entirely Frowned upon and there must be specific approval among each of the participating states’ athletic associations. This is done to Discourage national or even regional level competition at the high school level among high school teams. Swimmers and gymnasts can be on youth club teams and compete nationally. For the cross country and track, the top 10 to 20 are being Heavily recruited by NCAA D-1 programs and will probably become college winners quite early in their college careers.<|endoftext|>

I had friends in California who received speeding tickets on their bicycles for going 50 mph in a 35 mph marked speed zone (down hill).

Even those people training for a marathon should be at a 7.5 minute mile or Slower. And it is truly called a crosswalk, so 4 to 5 mph at the fastest so that you can see if the vehicles can see you and stop in time if you “run out” or skate out into the crosswalk.<|endoftext|>

However, those public colleges are just as good, in my opinion, as WPI or RPI for example. And those private colleges tend to be more expensive. So if you can’t get into MIT with very good MIT provided financial aid, and you don’t like your own state’s university system, then you will be fine at Penn State. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Take a look at maps of a similar scale and compare the 48 contiguous US states to Europe. It is 655 miles from Paris to Berlin and that seems to cover a fair amount of Europe. It is 440 miles from Boston to Washington DC and that is tiny for the USA. And along the Boston to Washington DC corridor there is a good rail system, albeit it could be much better if the Federal and state governments vastly improve the railway. Indeed, along that route, trains went faster in 1900 than they do in 2020. Europe is compact enough with a large population density to support a great interconnected railway system, same with Japan. However, in the USA there are several corridors that may support a good passenger railway system: BOS to Wash DC, St Louis to Chicago and San Diego to San Francisco or Sacramento. Otherwise the USA has a very low population density. And the USA built a great National Defense Highway system after World War II (commonly called the Interstate Highway System) so cars reign in the USA. For 300 miles you can drive and beyond 300 miles the airplane seems to dominate due the low population density. The passenger railway system has to improve (higher speed and more trains) to capture the 200 to 500 mile distances. Currently I can drive 250 to 350 miles (door to door) faster than I can take a train in the USA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Those two are Totally unrelated………. First you must convince the US college to accept you. Having $280,000 to pay for that college (in cash) with Zero financial aid, as well as being a good student will almost guarantee that. Money speaks and many colleges love to listen. However, you then have to separately (taking the I-20 form the college sends to you), meet with an US consulate staff member and convince that person that you will return to your own country after earning your degree. Since you have $280,000 in cash, you will easily pass the affordability check-box. Yet, even if you are given a F-2 student visa, depending upon the country in which you live, when you arrive at the US airport or border crossing you will be interviewed by a Customs and Border Patrol agent who works for a Different US government agency (Dept of Homeland Security) and that person may Void your F-1 visa on the spot and send you home (which you pay for). Enjoy the process. And apply for and get a B-2 tourist visa to the USA and visit the colleges with some of that $280,000 you have saved up. That may smooth the process for you.

Most if not all in-state public community colleges charge $6,000 or less for one year of tuition and mandatory fees. That assumes that the student is living at home or with relatives and commuting to the community college. In the USA, it is assumed that most people will pay what they can afford.

End of discussion. The EFC calculation arrives at a payment that the family can afford. Been there and done that.

<|startoftext|>Just because you met all of the listed requirements does not mean you get admitted. There are only “so many slots” for masters students each year. A number of those will be filled by KSU undergraduate students in that department who are invited to stay and do a masters degree by their professor or the department chairman. That leaves fewer slots open. Then the first of those slots go to masters candidates who are working in a niche area that lines up with a professor who needs a research assistant. Finally, the remaining few slots go to those who are doing a masters without a thesis and there may have been too many very good students (including you) who applied this year and they had a “lottery” and you didn’t make it.

<|startoftext|>They want to know Three things about you that: Maybe show how you overcame some adversity to reach your current level of success/achievement, How you interact well with others and therefore would be a valuable addition to the college’s undergraduate student Community, Why You (as a person and as a student) are really interested in that college and what you hope to gain by attending that college and what you hope to Assist that college’s undergraduate student community with while at the college. This third one may be a separate question Of course, those would require substantiation in the various letters of recommendation that are submitted on your behalf. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was on our school district’s SAC (Superintendent’s Advisory Committee) on STEAM in schools. Press Releases | For Press | News | RISD After considerable review, it was determined that the STEM portion was most lacking at the elementary school level where the teachers are typically required to teach all course work to the K-5th grade students. I suggested, given that many of the seniors in high school can opt for a three month project at the end of their senior year, that we get seniors to volunteer to tutor and assistant-teach STEM subject matter back at the elementary schools that they had attended years before. And, if a student has a STEM project in high school that they go on “tour with it” to the various elementary schools in the district to demonstrate the project. There were many other suggestions, but that was the primary one that Utilized the Students in the process. My suggestion is “developing legs” and slowly being used in the six elementary schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure The guidance counselor submits that letter of recommendation as a cover letter for the official transcript, and submits it directly to the college. It is mandatory and the applicant has no control over that. Additionally, if you apply early and are deferred, the guidance counselor has to submit your mid-year transcript (with the most recent grades) and another cover letter of recommendation/explaination directly to the college, and that letter could change. Finally, the guidance counselor must submit your final transcript and a cover letter of recommendation/explanation to the college for which you enrolled and paid a non-refundable deposit. If you changed over the previous several months then you can count on that letter changing the same way. Your high school guidance counselor is Very Important in the college application and college acceptance process….<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chemical engineering is the basis for the production and synthesis of hundreds if not thousands of “things” that the World’s society needs on a daily basis. And there are many solid material applications as well, indeed many composite material manufacturing processes depend upon the knowledge of Chemical Engineers. It is a very worthwhile career. Although a friend of mine at MIT went on for his PhD in Chemical Engineering but eventually became a senior pilot for FedEx and flies around the world…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nomenclature goes back many years. However, in general: A college is for an undergraduate education for a bachelors degree A university is generally an educational institute that awards masters and PhD degrees It is Harvard College of Harvard University for a bachelors degree and then there are various graduate schools/departments in the University for a masters or PhD Then there are institutes and polytechnic institutes for STEM centered universities: MIT, WPI, RPI, Caltech, etc Those are PhD granting universities that specialize in engineering and science and mathematics There are exceptions (College of William and Mary, and Dartmouth College), but the info above is general true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go back to that first university that offered you a PhD student slot and speak with someone in the department headquarters and also with one or two professors who are doing research in your niche area. However, you will need to Assure them that the distractions are Over. That you are healthy and that you have no more major requirements to care for your parent over the next Five years. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the USA, the Federal and state governments and all of the colleges believe that the Primary burden for paying for a child’s college education through a bachelors degree is the Family (parents). Period. My parents believed that. And we believed that for our sons. The parents have to meet the Expecte (more)<|endoftext|>

Is one of those languages a language that your family speaks at home? There has to be a reason to take more than one foreign language for four years each. (more)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would have to be worked out between the your parents, you and the two school systems. Typically, a child in that situation would attend school near one parent, and then spend the summer and part of winter break with the other parent. And, it is most likely that the schools would want/prefer one year in one school and then the complete next year in the other school, etc. Otherwise, your parents may be Forced to home school you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Did you require that “emotional support animal” in high school??? Or are you merely trying to game the system and bring a pet to college with you??? The cover letter from your high school guidance counselor that accompanies your official transcript to the college will have all of that included….. And all colleges (that I am aware of) in the USA require a complete physical by your medical doctor prior to arriving on campus to start college. (And psychiatrist if required). That must be submitted by your parents to the college medical center. If the emotional support animal is required, then it will be listed in that report. At that point, you may be placed in the dorms near the agriculture school on campus and you will have direct access to all of the horses, sheep, cows, goats and chickens……. Let’s see how supporting that is for you and your pet…..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One year of a foreign language is “kind-of” dumb. Most colleges that want a high school student to take a foreign language want at least the equivalent of 2 to 4 years (MIT and Harvard, respectively). However, if you were placed into the 4th year of the high school language and only took that and did well, then that satisfies the college. Or, if you believe you have the equivalent, then merely take the SAT Subject Test in that foreign language and do well. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They merely want the Equivalent of instruction. If there is any doubt, then merely take the SAT Subject test in that language. A good score seals the deal. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our two sons did that when they were 6 and 7 years old.

We will probably be hit by a tractor-trailer rig and all Killed, but that will be Your fault.” They stopped and were dead-still and their eyes started to Bug Out. Then they both said: Drive daddy, please drive, we don’t want to die….. Please…… Checked the mirrors and back on the highway and Never had a problem again with the two of them. Ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the classroom is a large auditorium like setting for Many people, then yes. But if it is just a normal room for 20 to 30 people then no. It is merely the door(s) that you used to enter the room, which are in plain site. Just like in high school. However, the exits from the Building must be designated with clearly marked Exit signs. Just like in a hotel. There is no exit sign over your hotel room. Same idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that the summation of four years of tuition and any mandatory fees (not room and board, not books and supplies) should be equal to the nominal starting salary in your field. In 1973, when I graduated from MIT with a bachelors degree, I stayed for graduate studies, But I could have started in the aerospace industry with my bachelors degree. Indeed, I had been a Co-Op student working in the aerospace industry from Feb-Aug of 1972 (2nd term junior year at North American Rockwell working on the B-1A bomber structural testing). The starting annual salary in 1973 for an aerospace engineer was roughly $12,000 per year. Over the previous four years, the summation of all my tuition and mandatory fees paid to MIT was (roughly) $10,000. And there were a Lot of aerospace jobs for $10,000 annual salary (I was offered $12,000). Today, four years of tuition and mandatory fees (Not room & board as that is separate), is about $205,000 . Who can start as a engineer for a salary of $205,000 per year with a bachelors degree? Using an inflation calculator from 1973 to 2020, that $10,000 annual salary job should be $58,000 per year. And that is about right. There are a lot of $60,000 per year annual salary jobs for engineers in the aerospace field. Therefore, the current cost of Tuition and Mandatory fees Per year at a college like MIT should be around $15,000 per year and not $51,000 per year…… Thus, here is how I would set tuition and mandatory fees (Not including room and board) Take the starting salaries of all of the graduates from that college from the previous year. Toss out the top 10% and the bottom 10% and average the other 80%. Divide that average by 4 and round up to the nearest thousand dollars, and that would be the cost for tuition. And the tuition would go up each year pegged to the rate of inflation in the USA. NOTE: I believe that a current bachelors degree aerospace student from MIT could start for $72,000 per year salary. Therefore, the annual tuition should be one-quarter of that or $18,000 per year. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr. Elman is 100% correct in his answer. However, in general, any engineer that works at an aerospace company is an “aerospace engineer”. Your degree will say that you are a Mechatronics Engineer, but you will be working on designing controllable mechanisms that go on aircraft or helicopters or rockets/missiles. You will be working on important Subsystems, but you won’t have the overall knowledge to understand how the whole aircraft, helicopter or missile truly works and what are the competing issues that drive its overall design. But you could be a very valuable engineer at that aerospace company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speak with the head of your department at that college, and see if you could get a Masters degree at the end of four years at the college. A bachelors degree after three years and then a masters in one more year (including the summer). A lot of people do that. Indeed, many can take their bachelors degree capstone project and extend that into a Masters thesis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you graduate high school this Spring and start college this coming Fall, then you will have five years to play four years of football. Therefore, if you sit out one of those seasons, you could play NCAA college football at age 23. However, if you enlist in the military and 5 years later get honorably discharged and start your college education, then you still get 5 years to play four seasons of a NCAA sport. And if you start college for the First time, at age 40, then you still get five years to play four seasons of that sport, starting the moment you start classes at that college. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, you already have a bachelors degree, plus almost four years of college (applying 2nd term senior year), and you have had at least two summers of work experience, and you have take a variety of courses in your major and did or are doing a Senior capstone project. Therefore, you are aware of the various niche areas in your major. You develop an affinity for one of those niche areas, have professional discussions with professors who do research in those areas, and then you decide on a course of action. You will read the professional journals that have recent articles related to your niche area and find the universities and the professors who are working in that niche area. You will then apply to the departments in those universities for admission as a Masters student that also is doing research (to pay the expenses for the Masters) in that niche area. Easy and thousands of people do that every year. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forget GPA. If there are 1000 high schools there are probably 1000 ways of calculating a GPA. If you attend a regular public high school, you should be in the top 10% if not top 5% of your graduating class, and be excellent in all of the STEM courses plus literature and history. If you attend a private school or a public exam school, then you should be in the top 20% of your graduating class, and be excellent in all of the STEM courses plus literature and history. That will get you noticed by MIT and in the running but is Insufficient as Valedictorians have been rejected. 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character (read the article, the links and the report): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And you must get several glowing-hot letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that. Easy. Goo luck.<|endoftext|>

However, one can major in Mechanical Engineering and then pursue a masters in Aero-Astro Engineering. The good news is that most of the colleges that offer an aeropace engineering major are very good colleges and all have an excellent set of other engineering departments. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because they can. Easy. The USA is a capitalistic society. However, the Federal direct loans have a much lower interest rate: Student Loan Interest Rates 2019: Your Guide to Understanding the Numbers I always preach: Try not to borrow more than $27,000 over four years to get a bachelors degree. That is the maximum amount you can get from the Federal direct loan program (in general) and it is easy to repay. No one should need more than that or they chose unwisely when starting college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. That is the responsibility of the Parents to teach their teenagers. My parents taught me, and we taught our children.

<|startoftext|>When you rent an apartment, you pay at the Beginning of the month…….. For most colleges that I am aware of, there is what the student owes to the college: tuition, mandatory fees, and possibly room and board. Prior to the start of each term (2 to 3 Months prior) the student is presented with a Bill for all of the expenses the student owes the college for that term. The student must pay all of that Before the term starts. Or the student may Pay to have a payment plan ($50 to $60 per term fee for the payment plan) and make three or four payments to the college. Those will Start, typically two months Prior to the start of classes. There is No Debt to the college. All loans are with the US Federal government or private loan agencies. And those loans are delivered to the college within three days after the start of classes by the loan agency. Money, that is what the colleges want and preferably CASH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of the elite Private US colleges have a very large Holistic method to admit freshmen. Because they are not just admitting students who wish to study, they are trying to build a very interactive and supportive undergraduate Community. Because Half of an undergraduate student’s education is the process of maturing from a raw teenager into an Adult along with all of the other undergraduates in that undergraduate Community. And, every college student should graduate with a bachelors degree that helps them on the path to their Vocation, but in that maturation process, they should also leave college with one or two Avocations. Mine were refereeing soccer at a high level and playing goaltender in ice hockey, and I still do both of them along with my career. Become more of a Human being and develop your personality and ability to work with others in society. That is the crux of an undergraduate education in college and why it is so important to Not look at the “status or ranking” of the college, but instead how well You and the College fit together.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Where? Epcot center in a closed and controlled environment? They probably already have fully autonomous cars on their “tracks”. Able to drive with No humans on board, safely from Boston, MA to Fairbanks Alaska in February and by itself, clean all the senors and fill up the fuel tank or recharge the batteries with No assistance from a human? Won’t happen until the next century if ever. Think of all of the laws in all of the States and Provinces that would need to be changed and what about the insurance industry? And what if 5% of the cars on the road are fully autonomous and the most of the other 95% are fully human operated? I can see a lot of accidents because of that. Good drivers can sense danger and can “sense” what another driver may do correctly or stupidly. What will that computer think and do? All of the car companies will be satisfied with humans paying a Lot of money to get Level 3 with a hint of Level 4 cars. But those car companies will stay a long way away from Level 5 and full autonomy. They want to make a profit and not get sued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does “most selective mean”??? It really means that the colleges are good at getting the word out and attracting a lot of applications. For example MIT has slots for 1,150 freshmen and will accept roughly 1,430 applicants hoping that 1,150 will enroll (rough number) which is a yield of 80%. A yield in excess of 75% is Excellent. Admissions statistics | MIT Admissions However, almost 22,000 people were “encouraged or decided to” apply. Yet only 1,150 can attend. So that gives MIT an acceptance rate of 6.7% which is “very selective”. Or does that merely mean that MIT was good at getting people to apply at $75 an application or almost $1.6 million in Income to the admissions office…… Not bad with a few web pages and some good words online….. And Stanford is even better at extracting money from applicants families. Roughly 1,750 freshmen attend each year with an acceptance rate of just under 5%. Or roughly 43,700 applicants at $90 each or almost $4 million extracted from families’ bank accounts….. So most selective merely means that they are great at “getting the word out” and extracting money from your bank accounts……. Nice and thank you for your donations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You could. But I am not certain what impact it would have. Are you on your nation’s or region’s top rugby team for your age group? Hopefully the answer is Yes, otherwise why would NCAA D-1A or D-1AA teams be interested? Would you be available to come to the USA and participate in a summer tackle football camp prior to the start of your last year of high school in your country? It takes money to make money, and some football scholarships are worth more than $280,000 plus the education that you gain. Otherwise, you merely get admitted to a good US college that is good fit for you without tackle football and hopefully with a very good rugby club. Then you try-out for the tackle football team when you arrive early (30 days early) on campus, staying in a local hotel (it takes money to make money)….. If you can catch the head coach’s interest, they may allow you to work out with the special teams: kick-off and punt coverage teams. Most likely on defense, as you would then be required to tackle (like in rugby) someone running with the ball in the open field. Go to the colleges’ athletic web sites, and note the size of the current players on those teams. Here is an example: Football the height is in feet and inches and the weight is in pounds. If you are not of that size category, then your chances are Hugely diminished. And you will need to bench press and least twice your body weight. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The human body is very much like a complicated machine.

<|startoftext|>First: A gap is a gap. Period. Second: Please, still apply to colleges when you are 17 and get admitted to one that is a great fit for you, and then tell the college that you really want to start as a freshman One Year later. Most (almost all) colleges will say Yes, and then assist you in any way that they can in planning a great and productive (for you as a person) gap year. What will be Difficult is graduating high school and then trying to take a gap, since the college application process starts a couple of months later. So, how do you have a productive gap for you if you have to apply to colleges, go back to your old high school and convince the guidance counselor and teachers to write letters of recommendation for you or even to work with you again as they will be overloaded with the current “crop of seniors” applying for college. Work with your guidance counselor and several trusted teachers to think this through completely. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FAFSA is merely the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

The worse your driving record, the higher the probability of an accident and therefore the more that you pay The number of miles that the car is driven annually. The fewer miles driven, the less chance of an accident Where the car is parked over night and if you use the car to drive to work, where do you work That takes into account the probability of the car being stolen or damaged where it is parked at night and during the day That also takes into account the region where it will be driven the most and therefore what is the probability of an accident in that region Enjoy your car and driving it.<|endoftext|>

Yet, easily More than half of the applicants have more than sufficient academic prowess to attend the college, survive freshman year, do well in a major and graduate in a timely manner. That is Required but Insufficient. Those colleges use a highly holistic process to choose their accepted applicants: I claim that 75% will be your extracurricular activities (in school or in your extended community) that collectively demonstrate: Leadership, Commitment, Passion, Excellent time management, a Warm interpersonal relationship with others in a team-building setting, and Character (read the article, the links and the report): Stu Schmill endorses report on consideration of character in college admissions And you must get several glowing letters of recommendation that substantiate all of that. NOTE: MIT, Harvard and 80+ other peer institutions, including Stanford, wrote that report. Read the Complete Stanford admissions web site to learn what they are seeking.

<|startoftext|>We do have flying cars (or “motorcycles”) The Transition | The Flying Car Is Here | Terrafugia The PAL-V Liberty claims to be the first commercially available flying car (Motorcycle, it is three wheels) AeroMobil 4.0 STOL In general, they are Not flying cars but “roadable airplanes” e.g., one would not drive one of these to do the family shopping but one could drive to avoid fog or other weather that would ground an airplane. In the USA, the “flying car” must pass two sets of regulations: NHTSA regulations for safety for cars and motorcycles Motorcycles (two or three wheels) have far fewer regulations than cars (four or more wheels) FAA for a light sport airplane Because of the stringent regulations, Terrafugia had to get a waiver from the FAA to have more weight and a higher landing speed because of the extra weight required by NHTSA to meet the US automobile safety standards. And the air traffic regulations are already there: it is part of the USA or European Air Traffic Control. However in order to take-off or land, that must be done (on a regular basis) at an approved airport…….. Therefore, for Many more years, we will only have Very expensive roadable airplanes.

<|startoftext|>First it is the USA: United States of America There are 50 states plus the District of Columbia and therefore 51 different answers because most laws that affect the individual are at the state level. However, if you are 18 or older and hold a valid full drivers license from your country and are on a valid visa (if required) to be in the USA, then you may drive in any state of the USA. The international drivers permit merely translates your country’s drivers license into English for any police officer in the USA. You will need to have with you: Your current full drivers license Your IDP if your license is not in English Your passport with visa (if a visa is required). NOTE: If you are in the USA on a long term work visa you will need to get a drivers license in the state in which you will reside, typically 30 days after living and working in that state. Enjoy your time in the USA and be careful while driving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. Two of my close friends in the 1970’s never got their learners permit nor their drivers licenses until they had graduated from college: One before starting his PhD work and the other when he had completed his PhD degree. Neither one of them needed to drive before then. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you look at the Harvey Mudd web site: Degrees Awarded | Harvey Mudd College you will note that they have Not awarded a Masters in Engineering since 2003. Harvey Mudd is a College and as such, it focuses on undergraduate students and bachelors degrees. I would imagine that it is fairly easy to attend an UC or one of the two Cal Poly campuses to get a masters degree if you do reasonably well at Harvey Mudd. Additionally, Stanford, USC and Caltech are comparatively near-by and will look favorably upon a very good Harvey Mudd student. Similar to getting a bachelors in engineering from the Olin College of Engineering near Boston. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

Even better, in the 1960’s the US Navy, for July 4th, would tow an old ship from San Diego out to sea a few miles from shore. We would gather and then a cruiser and a battleship would open fire with 16 inch and 6 inch cannon fire. The old ship was stuffed with old explosives and would Blow Up and sink.

Live bands at the high school and occasionally a live band at the church hall. We just went to the dance, and danced with whomever was there. Just say to the fellow: “I’m going to the XXX dance YYY night. I hope to see you there.” Easy. Then when you are both there, you dance. Super easy.

<|startoftext|>Yes. Primarily because there are alternatives. Our high school has a very wide selection in subjects and most of the students are more than satisfied.
