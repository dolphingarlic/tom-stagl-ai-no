# Tom StaglAIno

Since incoherent text generated by GPT-2 and Tom's Quora answers are both great for laughs, I asked myself: hey, what if I combined those two?

Introducing Tom StaglAIno™: the latest and greatest technological advancement in giving questionable advice! Using GPT-2 (and 3000 answers scraped from Quora's slow and terrible website), I was able to emulate Tom almost perfectly.

- `USA??? The only way to get a F-1 student visa to attend college in the USA is to apply to your college’s campus police department, who are independent bodies and have independent rules for the admission of college students. Indeed, many of the US elite Private colleges have Volunteer Explorers who go to other planets to explore….. During the pandemic you should have: Been in a good-paying job for a while, and are now satisfied with your college education. Been recruited by one of the colleges to be a college ice hockey or team captain and then offered a scholarship to college. However, your application could have gone either way, but I believe the F-1 colleges (USA and Canada) like to have freshmen applicants compete every year for a single year with seniors…`
